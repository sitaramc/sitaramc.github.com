<h1>rules for .gitignore and the like</h1>

<p>Those of you who have read the manual for gitignore will have noticed that,
while the rules for precedence of the various files (pattern sources) are very
clear, the rules for the actual exclusion patterns are somewhat less so.
They're certainly accurate, but newcomers have to read very carefully if they
want to do anything moderately complex with their exclude rules.</p>

<p>One day (2009-02-18, ~16:00 IST, to be precise), 'doener' (Bj√∂rn Steinbrink)
came up with some much simpler rules that said the same thing, and -- building
on the insight that his rules gave me -- I came up with these:</p>

<hr />

<p>Note that rule 1 merely <em>modifies</em> rules 2 and 3, it does not supercede or
preclude them.</p>

<ol>
<li>If your pattern ends with a slash, it matches only directories (and their
contents)</li>
<li>If there is no slash otherwise, it matches that name, at any depth in the
tree</li>
<li>If there is a slash anywhere else, it matches that name, relative to the
.gitignore (or <code>$GIT_WORK_TREE</code> if the pattern is from one of the other
pattern sources like <code>.git/info/exclude</code> etc)</li>
</ol>

<p>The wildcards (<code>*</code> and <code>?</code>) do not match slashes, but otherwise the patterns
are normal shell globs as defined by fnmatch(3) with the <code>FNM_PATHNAME</code> flag
set.</p>

<hr />

<p><font size=-1>Just for completeness, the pattern source priorities are, highest to lowest:</p>

<ul>
<li>command line</li>
<li>the deepest .gitignore that applies to this path</li>
<li>shallower .gitignore files until you get to <code>$GIT_WORK_TREE</code>
<ul>
<li>patterns in .gitignore files are relative to the location of the
gitignore file, not to the <code>$GIT_WORK_TREE</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>$GIT_DIR/info/exclude</code></li>
<li>core.excludesfile</li>
</ul>

<p></font></p>
