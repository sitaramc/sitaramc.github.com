<h1>backing up a repo by just: git push backup</h1>

<p>This is, like many things in this directory, by doener, on irc circa
2009-03-25 19:24 Wed IST</p>

<pre><code>mkdir -p ~/backups/projectX.git
cd ~/backups/projectX.git
git init --bare
# see notes below for these two
git config core.logAllRefUpdates true
git config receive.denyDeletes true

cd /path/to/projectX
git remote add -t dont_fetch_from_the_backup --mirror backup ~/backups/projectX.git
</code></pre>

<p>Here is some documentation (paraphrased from the irc chat log).</p>

<p>It creates a bare repo to store the backup, adds a remote to the "work" repo
and then pushes.  The <code>--mirror</code> bit makes the remote act as a mirror (i.e.
"git push" will default to <code>--mirrror</code> for this remote) The <code>-t
dont_fetch_from_the_backup</code> is there because, normally, with <code>--mirror</code> you
get a bidirectional mirror setup, i.e. fetch is set to <code>refs/*:refs/*</code>, and
you don't want an accidental fetch to kill your work.  Of course simply
unsetting <code>remote.backup.fetch</code> would also do, but the error message for the
invalid ref reminds you you shouldn't be doing that.</p>

<p>My additions:  I hope that by adding the two config variables above, I can
allow non-fast forward pushes, letting the reflog act as a safety net as
usual.  The reflog does not protect from a deleted branch, hence we disallow
that (that is rare enough that I can do it manually if I need to).</p>
