<h1>who pushed this particular commit?</h1>

<p><strong>WARNING: THIS DOCUMENT IS OBSOLETE</strong></p>

<p>Just install gitolite -- it'll produce a much better log than anything you'll
get from this document.  See the "better logging" section of
<a href="http://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite/blob/master/doc/3-faq-tips-etc.mkd">http://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite/blob/master/doc/3-faq-tips-etc.mkd</a></p>

<p><strong>I'm keeping this document around only to show you how difficult this is
without gitolite ;-)</strong></p>

<p>Gitolite is at <a href="http://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite">http://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite</a></p>

<p>... and now, on to the document</p>

<hr />

<p>Someone on IRC postulated that git does not track who pushed a series of
commits into a server, and could allow one dev to blame some other dev by
pushing stuff with the victim's name/email as the author/committer.</p>

<p>The first answer to this of course is that you can force everything to happen
with gpg-signed tags -- the project pulls only gpg-signed tags, and if you
signed a tag (which in turn stamps the entire commit DAG upto that point) then
you'd better know what you're doing!</p>

<p>However, we don't always sign like this; it makes it cumbersome and it
requires all the devs to conform to this discipline, and is too big a price to
pay for something that may never happen.  We need something that'll just sit
in the background, saving enough info for us to track "after the fact", should
it ever become necessary.</p>

<p><a name="the_list_and_irc_real_blame_one_time_setup_"></a></p>

<h2>one-time setup</h2>

<p>So, the short answer, for a gitosis-administered central repo, is this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>(as root) in <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>, add the following lines (or change
INFO to VERBOSE if that's already present)</p>

<pre><code># Logging
SyslogFacility AUTH
LogLevel VERBOSE
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>(as the "git" user) in each repository of interest (or globally, by adding
<code>--global</code>; highly recommended for servers), do the following.  The second command is useful even in
general, but in this case the relevance is that deleting a branch wipes
out its reflog too, so you want to prevent that:</p>

<pre><code>git config core.logAllRefUpdates true
git config receive.denyDeletes true
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>That's it.  Of course, if your system logs get deleted after about 4 weeks or
so, you may want to keep <code>auth.log</code> out of it or do something to preserve
those logs for a longer period of time.</p>

<p><a name="the_list_and_irc_real_blame_investigation_"></a></p>

<h2>investigation</h2>

<p>So let's say you look at the reflog and find you want to know who pushed a
particular commit[1]</p>

<pre><code>git@git:~/repositories/testing.git$ git reflog
582b3ad... HEAD@{0}: push
f0a5fc1...
</code></pre>

<p>You're interested in <code>582b3ad</code>, so you do the following (note that the output
line below is wrapped for the purposes of this page):</p>

<pre><code>git@git:~/repositories/testing.git$ grep -r ' 582b3' logs
logs/HEAD:f0a5fc1171c967a7af975fc454a25a599066565b
    582b3ad0219d922a9aed6f5cbb3f4f9a5741df6b git master user
    &lt;git@my.domain.com&gt; 1238837842 +0530      push
</code></pre>

<p>There's a timestamp in there, that <code>1238837842</code> thing, which you have to
decode:</p>

<pre><code>$ perl -le 'print scalar(localtime $ARGV[0])' 1238837842
Sat Apr  4 15:07:22 2009
</code></pre>

<p>Come Watson, the game is afoot...</p>

<pre><code>root@git:/var/log# grep Apr..4.15:07 auth.log

</code></pre>

<p>Now go to a clone of the gitosis-admin directory, and do this (I've removed
the <code>&gt;</code> signs that normally form <code>$PS2</code> so you can copy-paste this):</p>

<pre><code>$ cd keydir
$ for i in *.pub
do
    cat $i | while read r
    do
        echo "$r" &gt; /tmp/junk.pubkey
        ssh-keygen -l -f /tmp/junk.pubkey |grep fc.c1.48 &amp;&amp;
            echo ===== $i matched =====
    done
done
2048 fc:c1:48:1e:06:31:97:a4:8b:fc:37:b2:76:14:c7:53 /tmp/junk.pubkey (RSA)
===== sitaram.pub matched =====
</code></pre>

<p>And we've nailed him :-)</p>

<p>^^
PS: a note on that shell snippet: you need to do it this way because a gitosis
pubkey file can contain more than one pubkey (for the same user of course) in
it.  Typically this is because of using different machines or whatever.  If
you pass such a file to <code>ssh-keygen -l</code> it'll only compute the fingerprint of
the first pubkey in the file.  I found this out quite luckily -- I'd
completely forgotten about the multiple keys per file thing...!
^^</p>

<hr />

<p>^^
[1] The reflog stores only the "tip" of a series of commits, so if the
suspicious commit is in the middle of a series which was pushed all at once,
you have some extra work.</p>

<p>The basic idea is, you take the second SHA in each reflog line, check
if it is a descendent of the commit you want, note the timestamp if so, and
then choose the earliest among them to go check in <code>auth.log</code>.</p>

<p>I'll write a script to do this if someone asks... right now I can't be
bothered :-)
^^</p>
