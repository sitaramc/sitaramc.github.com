<h1>souping up your bash prompt</h1>

<p>This document describes how to get command completion as well as a souped up
bash prompt.</p>

<p>Git comes with a bash script in the 'contrib/completion' directory which takes
care of command completion as well as displaying the current branch name in your
<code>PS1</code> (primary bash prompt).  We use that as a basis, and -- without digging
inside of it (meaning you can upgrade that without worry) -- we add more
functionality.</p>

<p><a name="2_command_line_usage_souped_up_bash_prompt_Summary_for_the_impatient_expert_"></a></p>

<h2>Summary for the impatient/expert</h2>

<ul>
<li>normally, shows whatever <code>__git_ps1</code> sends back.  That is, completion,
branch name, and branch state text come from <code>__git_ps1</code>, in
'contrib/completion/git-completion.bash' in the git source tree</li>
<li><p>but when you</p>

<ul>
<li>switch branches, or</li>
<li>change current working directory, or</li>
<li><em>hit enter twice in quick succession at the bash prompt</em> (!!)</li>
</ul>

<p><p>it shows a color-coded count of files in various states: unmerged (bold
red), untracked (blue), modified (red), and staged (green).  In addition,
the branch name reported by <code>__git_ps1</code> is also colored (for example,
bright red when the head is detached).</p></li>
</ul>
You might be wondering about that "hit enter twice in quick succession" piece
:-) The idea is that it should be as convenient and accessible as the current
implementation, but it shouldn't really happen on <em>every</em> prompt because it's
expensive to compute and could delay the prompt.</p>

<p>The implementation is either a neat and elegant hack or kludge city, depending
on whom you ask :)</p>

<p><a name="2_command_line_usage_souped_up_bash_prompt_Details_"></a></p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>For a while, I've wanted a quick summary of <code>git status</code> -- how many files are
staged (<code>git add</code>ed), modified, untracked, unmerged, etc.  I've also wanted a
quick indication of whether the current HEAD is a detached head, etc.  And I
wanted it to be as compact as possible.</p>

<p>But...  I didn't want 'git status' to run on every prompt -- that would be too
expensive for some of the msysgit users I support.  I wanted this extra piece
to kick in only when</p>

<ul>
<li>I change directories, or</li>
<li>I switch branches, or the branch state changes, or</li>
<li>when I want it to, but I'm too lazy to type a command to tell it (also
called psychic mode!)</li>
</ul>

<p>That last part was tough, but I'm pleased that my solution not only works, it
even works on msysgit so my Windows users are happy too!</p>

<p><a name="2_command_line_usage_souped_up_bash_prompt_Download_bash_script_"></a></p>

<h3>Download bash script</h3>

<p>The part that computes the status and summarises it with colored numbers is a
hacked up version of git://github.com/lvv/git-prompt.git), and you can
download it <a href="tools/git-completion-plus.bash.txt">here</a>.  And here's a
<a href="tools/git-completion-plus.bash.html">syntax colored</a> version to quickly
view on a browser.  You're expected to source it into your <code>.bashrc</code>; it'll
take care of sourcing the git-supplied one, which it looks for in <code>$HOME</code>.</p>

<p>After that, you need to include the snippet of bash code given in <a href="#extracode">this
section</a>.  I used to have all this in one file, but the code to
detect the quick-double-enter has uses outside git also, so I separated that
logic from the 'git status colorisation' stuff.</p>

<h3>Screenshot</h3>

<p>[Update 2009-03-19: the screenshot is not quite current but will suffice to
give you the general idea]</p>

<p>Someone asked for a screenshot so <a href="images/git-completion-plus.png">here is
one</a>; it should give you enough of an idea.
You can see the extra information (namely, the output of <code>__git_ps1</code> being
colored, and a few numbers after that in different colors at certain places:</p>

<ul>
<li>when I hit enter twice quickly (the timestamps on the left side will tell
you when I did that)</li>
<li>when the output of <code>__git_ps1</code> changes (this is the bit inside
parentheses)</li>
</ul>

<p>The color choices retain the colors that git status shows (with <code>git config
--global color.ui true</code>) for staged and modified files -- this is green and
red, respectively.  <code>git status</code> uses red for untracked files also, but we use
blue.  Unmerged files are magenta.</p>

<p>I didn't show changing to another directory and coming back -- that would also
trigger the extra info.  I also didn't show all 4 colors (staged, modified,
untracked, unmerged) at the same time but I'm sure you get the idea.</p>

<p><a name="2_command_line_usage_souped_up_bash_prompt_Supplementary_code_"></a></p>

<h3>Supplementary code</h3>

<p>The following code contains the hack to do something different if you hit
enter twice in quick succession.  It need to be run via bash's
<code>PROMPT_COMMAND</code> mechanism -- do not call it directly from <code>PS1</code> using the
<code>$(bash_command)</code> syntax.  That syntax runs things in a sub-shell, which won't
let you maintain state.</p>

<p>You'll notice there's git-specific stuff in there.  The idea is that if you
need some <em>other</em> information (like, perhaps, percentage disk free, or maybe
system load, if you don't have conky or gkrellm), then that also can use the
same mechanism; you'd just add bits of code in here, piggy-backing on the
logic already present to make things run only sometimes instead of on every
prompt.</p>

<p>Of course you can change the <code>PS1=[...]</code> lines however you like.</p>

<pre><code>export PROMPT_COMMAND=__ps1_plus
__ps1_plus()

    # elegant hack or extreme kludgery?  You decide...

    # I wanted a way to see a long prompt very conveniently, but
    # not on *every* prompt -- hitting enter twice in quick succession at the
    # bash prompt was about as much as I was willing to do :-)

    # The hack works by remembering the $SECONDS value at the end of each
    # unsuccesful invocation.  When the next invocation still has the same
    # $SECONDS, you know the user hit enter twice, so you do the 'git status'
    # stuff.

    # In addition, of course, if the PWD or the output of __git_ps1 itself
    # changed, that also triggers the extra stuff.

    local gitps1
    declare -F __git_ps1 &gt;/dev/null &amp;&amp; gitps1=$(__git_ps1)
    if [[ $__ps1_state != $PWD/$gitps1 || $__ps1_plus_last -eq $SECONDS ]]
    then
        __ps1_state=$PWD/$gitps1

        # if enhanced PS1 builder exists call it to set __git_ps1_text;
        # otherwise default is the git-distributed one
        __git_ps1_text=$gitps1
        declare -F __git_ps1_plus &gt;/dev/null &amp;&amp; __git_ps1_plus

        echo -n -e '\e]0;'${HOSTNAME%%.*}:
