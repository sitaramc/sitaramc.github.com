<h1 class="title">what does &quot;git pull --rebase&quot; do?</h1>
</div>
<p>[To understand this article you need to understand what a reflog is, and what a rebase does, especially the full form of the rebase command]</p>
<p>[My initial article was a little simplistic; more exact details added thanks to doener!]</p>
<hr />
<p>Sometimes we have an upstream that rebased/rewound a branch we're depending on. This can be a big problem -- causing messy conflicts for us if we're downstream.</p>
<p>Without going into why they would do that, and how many beers (I prefer rum+coke, thank you!) should be offered in compensation to downstream users, let's just try and describe how git helps you deal with it.</p>
<p>The magic is <code>git pull --rebase</code>.</p>
<p>A normal <code>git pull</code> is, loosely speaking, something like this (we'll use a remote called <code>origin</code> and a branch called <code>foo</code> in all these examples):</p>
<pre><code># assume current checked out branch is &quot;foo&quot;
git fetch origin
git merge origin/foo</code></pre>
<p>At first glance, you might think that a <code>git pull --rebase</code> does just this:</p>
<pre><code>git fetch origin
git rebase origin/foo</code></pre>
<p>But that will not help if the upstream rebase involved any &quot;squashing&quot; (meaning that the <code>patch-id</code>s of the commits changed, not just their order).</p>
<p>Which means <code>git pull --rebase</code> has to do a little bit more than that. Here's an explanation of what it does and how.</p>
<p>Let's say your starting point is this:</p>
<pre><code>a---b---c---d---e  (origin/foo) (also your local &quot;foo&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Time passes, and you have made some commits on top of your own &quot;foo&quot;:</p>
<pre><code>a---b---c---d---e---p---q---r (foo)</code></pre>
<p>Meanwhile, in a fit of anti-social rage, the upstream maintainer has not only rebased his &quot;foo&quot;, he even used a squash or two. His commit chain now looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>a---b+c---d+e---f  (origin/foo)</code></pre>
<p>A <code>git pull</code> at this point would result in chaos. Even a <code>git fetch; git rebase origin/foo</code> would not cut it, because commits &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot; on one side, and commit &quot;b+c&quot; on the other, would conflict. (And similarly with d, e, and d+e).</p>
<p>What <code>git pull --rebase</code> does, in this case, is:</p>
<pre><code>git fetch origin
git rebase --onto origin/foo e foo</code></pre>
<p>This gives you:</p>
<pre><code>a---b+c---d+e---f---p---q---r (foo)</code></pre>
<p>You may still get conflicts, but they will be genuine conflicts (between p/q/r and a/b+c/d+e/f), and not conflicts caused by b/c conflicting with b+c, etc.</p>
<hr />
<p>So how does this actually work?</p>
<p>The command tries to find out which commits are <em>really</em> your local ones, and which had come from upstream in an earlier fetch.</p>
<p>To do this, it looks at the reflog of the remote tracking branch (<code>origin/foo</code>, in this case). This reflog represents the tips of successive <code>git fetch</code> operations on <code>origin</code>, in &quot;most recent first&quot; order.</p>
<p>For each reflog entry, (<code>origin/foo@{1}</code>, then <code>...{2}</code>, and so on) it checks if that commit is an ancestor of the current branch head <code>foo</code>. As soon as it finds one, it picks it as the starting point for the rebase (<code>e</code> in the example above).</p>
<p>That might sound a little complicated, but it works out fine. Just try it next time your upstream rebases something on you.</p>
