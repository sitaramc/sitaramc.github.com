<dt><strong>Update: Dec 2013</strong>.</dt>
<dd><p>Of all the stuff I dumped in the &quot;archived/&quot; directory, this is probably the most out of date. Over the last few years, Hg has, I think, managed to get rid of most of the early craziness with respect to branching (exacerbated by, in my <em>firm</em> opinion, a huge dollop of NIH syndrome!).</p>
<p>I actually tried to learn it a couple of times, but gave up. I didn't see any real advantages to it, but more important, I find I get <em>seriously</em> turned off when I see tutorials conflating &quot;branch&quot; and &quot;clone&quot;.</p>

<p>Hg is almost as good as git. Linus pretty much says so in his famous googletalk.</p>
<p>Almost :-)</p>
<p>Here're some links about Hg; detailed commentary from me may come later, but I doubt I will have the time or the inclination. It's not like this is SVN and I have to strenuously keep you away from it -- go ahead and use Hg if you like it and it fits your work style :-)</p>
<p>Also, I have no intention of becoming an Hg expert to answer questions or criticisms about this page. If you think something is wrong, tell me and I'd be happy to update it.</p>
<h1 id="local-branches"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Local branches</h1>
<p>Hg does not permit a quick experimental branch just to test some wild idea quickly. Check out the &quot;Branch Management&quot; section in <a href="http://www.rockstarprogrammer.org/post/2008/apr/06/differences-between-mercurial-and-git/">http://www.rockstarprogrammer.org/post/2008/apr/06/differences-between-mercurial-and-git/</a>.</p>
<p>Read the last 3 paras of that section, at least.</p>
<!--

Also, because the branch name is in the changeset, the branch lives forever.
The only short-term branches are clone branches. That just doesn't encourage
quick experiments.

In git, a branch is just a head (see above). Making changes to a branch
actually moves the pointer to the new changeset. This head must be explicitly
shared across repositories.

In practice, this drops the cost down to approximately zero. You won't
accidentally push code you don't mean to. You won't have to be reminded of a
failed experiment for the rest of your life, and you won't have to fear
naming them in such a way that they don't collide with something someone else
has done somewhere else.

<p><em>&quot;As good, performant Win32 (and Mac and Linux) is a hard-requirement, Git lost in early Kombat rounds. This is unfortunate because (as we would soon find out), lots of issues with the other systems did &quot;just work&quot; in Git.&quot;</em></p>

Having your repository be just a giant DAG of commits is what you want -- forcing each fork in the road to live in its own separate repository is a pain and unnecessary.</em></li>
