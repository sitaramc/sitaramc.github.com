<h1>notes on "eg" (Elijah Newren's "easy git")</h1>

<p>(Warning: probably out of date)</p>

<p>^^<a href="http://www.gnome.org/~newren/eg/">eg</a> is a single file wrapper for <code>git</code>
that provides much more user-friendly options and more sensible defaults for
many commands.  It's a great tool, the documentation is top class, the focus
on consistency and layering etc., is very nice, and clearly a lot of TLC has
gone into making it.</p>

<p>I'm not sure I like the whole package, but the nice thing is that eg co-exists
quite happily with normal git, so you can mix and match -- use only those eg
commands that you like, and ignore the others.</p>

<p>In this note, I explain some of the eg commands, and their advantages (or
lack) compared to plain git.  This is essentially my personal notes on "eg",
describing what I like, what I don't, etc., focusing mainly on commands where
the behaviour is <em>significantly</em> different from plain git.^^</p>

<p><a name="other_stuff_eg_really_useful_commands_"></a></p>

<h2>really useful commands</h2>

<p><a name="other_stuff_eg_eg_revert_and_eg_cherry_pick__"></a></p>

<h3><code>eg revert</code> and <code>eg cherry-pick</code></h3>

<p><code>eg revert</code> eliminates a lot of the confusion between plain git's various
ways of getting at old content.  This command's help text has the longest
description of the differences from plain git.  At the same time, git's own
"revert" command is done in eg by <code>eg cherry-pick -R</code>, which actually
makes a lot of sense.</p>

<p>The most important feature that "eg revert" provides is <code>eg revert --in REV
FILE</code>.  This reverts the change to FILE made in revision REV.  It's a
partial revert of an earlier commit.  This does not actually have a single
command equivalent in plain git, and it is done by piping a suitable <code>git
diff</code> to <code>git apply -R</code>.</p>

<p>The second variation is <code>eg revert --since REV FILE</code>, which reverts FILE
to the content it had in revision REV.  This is plain git's checkout paths
mode.</p>

<h3>other commands</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><code>eg info</code> is pretty cool :-)</p></li>
<li><p><code>eg publish</code> is neat too; as the man page says, normal git makes it
quite annoying (I wish you could clone from an empty repo -- that by
itself would make things a lot easier)</p></li>
<li><p><code>eg bundle create</code> adds <code>--all HEAD</code> to the normal command.  eg
also provides <code>eg bundle create-update new.bdl old.bdl</code> which is
functionally the same as</p>

<pre><code>git bundle create new.bdl --all HEAD --not \
    $(git ls-remote old.bdl | cut -f1)
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<h2>not (so) useful commands</h2>

<p><a name="other_stuff_eg_eg_diff__"></a></p>

<h3><code>eg diff</code></h3>

<p><code>eg diff</code> shows changes against HEAD, not the index.  I prefer the normal
git behaviour, for reasons cited in
<a href="concepts/uses-of-index.html">uses of index</a></p>

<p><code>eg diff</code>'s second change from normal git (see
<a href="http://www.gnome.org/~newren/eg/documentation/diff.html">http://www.gnome.org/~newren/eg/documentation/diff.html</a>) seems logical on the
face of it, but I'm not buying.  <code>diff</code> and <code>log</code> are inherently
different commands with different purposes and outputs, and it's meaningless
to try and synchronise their syntax.</p>

<p>To start with, these points are fundamental:</p>

<ul>
<li>the older revision is (normally) specified on the left side (LHS)</li>
<li>"diff" only works on two <em>endpoint</em> commits, regardless of how many
commits exist in between those endpoints</li>
<li>however, "log" works on all the in between commits also</li>
<li>normal, everyday, usage is <code>git diff A..B</code>, meaning "changes from A to
B", and <code>git log A..B</code>, meaning "commits in B but not in A".</li>
</ul>

<p>To those simple rules, add just one more (easy enough to remember): the
"<code>...</code>" operator always involves the common ancestor somehow.</p>

<p>With those rules in mind, you can keep track of what the double-dot and
triple-dot mean very easily.</p>

<p>Consider <code>git diff A...B</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li>since the "<code>...</code>" is used, the common ancestor is involved</li>
<li>since diff can only deal with 2 end points, one of A or B has to make way
for the common ancestor</li>
<li>since the common ancestor is older than A and B, clearly it has to appear
on the left side, so A loses :-)</li>
</ul>

<p>And this becomes <code>git diff CA(A,B)..B</code>, where CA(A,B) is the common
ancestor of A and B.  Easy enough?</p>

<p>Now look at <code>git log A...B</code></p>

<ul>
<li>again, the "<code>...</code>" is used, so the common ancestor is involved</li>
<li>since log is not constrained to only 2 endpoints like diff is, you don't
have to discard A or B</li>
<li>so you show the commits between the common ancestor and A, <em>as well as</em>
between the common ancestor and B</li>
</ul>

<p>So: <code>git log CA(A,B)..A</code> PLUS <code>git log CA(A,B)..B</code></p>

<p><a name="other_stuff_eg_other_commands_"></a></p>

<h3>other commands</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><code>eg log</code> doesn't seem to add much value compared to <code>--decorate</code>,
plus it eats up the colors</p></li>
<li><p><code>eg commit</code> attempts to simplify the many combinations you can have
(untracked, tracked+changed, tracked+changed+staged, etc) but I don't
think it succeeds very well (this is a subjective opinion, not fact!).
But really, if the command line options to stage and unstage confuse you,
just use <code>git gui</code>, where the icons and the two panes on the left tell
you all you want to know.  Couldn't be simpler than that.</p></li>
</ul>
