<h1>converting CVS to git</h1>

<p>Update 2009-10-08: It has been pointed out that cvsimport, which I recommend
against using below, can do incremental imports.  If this is important to you
(it wasn't, to me, and it never will be), then this document is probably no
use to you.  Sorry...</p>

<hr />

<p>First: do <strong>NOT</strong> use the builtin <code>git cvsimport</code> unless your repository is
very simple and linear.  Problems I had using it on a moderately complex repo
include missing tags, branches grafted to the wrong place (by comparing with a
<code>--simplify-by-decoration</code> tree later), missing commits (which is what
originally made me start investigating), and even missing files in the root of
the repo!!</p>

<p>It's been too long since I last used CVS to figure this out, and cvs2svn
seemed to deal with a lot more nuances, so I used that instead.</p>

<p><a name="other_stuff_cvs2git_step_1_make_a_dump_file_"></a></p>

<h2>step 1 -- make a dump file</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>download cvs2svn version 2.1 or higher from somewhere within
<a href="http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/cvs2git.html">http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/cvs2git.html</a>. DO NOT BE DISTRACTED BY THE
MISLEADING REFERENCES TO A MYTHICAL <code>cvs2git</code> COMMAND IN THAT PAGE :)  As
of the time I tried this, it didn't exist.  Maybe now it does...</p></li>
<li><p>expand it somewhere, and cd there</p></li>
<li><p>in there, create an options file from the original, like shown in the
<a href="#patch">patch</a> at the end of this file (change accordingly of course;
this diff only shows where you should make the changes, not what)</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT WARNING</strong></p>

<p>DO NOT USE the <code>test-data/main-cvsrepos/cvs2svn-git.options</code> file as a
starting point.  Though the intermediate files were about 3X smaller when
I used it, there were lots of inaccuracies w.r.t the $id type stuff, and
for some older tags whole files were missing, compared to the
corresponding CVS checkout.  The <code>-inline</code> version seems to work fine; no
errors on any of the 30 or so tags I checked on a project that had about 5
years of work in CVS.</p></li>
<li><p>run</p>

<pre><code>./cvs2svn --options=my.c2soptions
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>when it completes, check the <code>cvs2svn-tmp</code> directory for a rather large
file called git-dump.dat</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="other_stuff_cvs2git_step_2_import_into_git_"></a></p>

<h2>step 2 -- import into git</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>make an empty directory, cd to it, git init, then run</p>

<pre><code>cat ~-/cvs2svn-tmp/git-dump.dat | git fast-import
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>if you used the non-inline options file, or wanted to test that as well,
there would be <em>two</em> files in the cvs2svn-tmp directory, and the command
would now be:</p>

<pre><code>cat ~-/cvs2svn-tmp/git-{blob,dump}.dat | git fast-import
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="patch"></a></p>
