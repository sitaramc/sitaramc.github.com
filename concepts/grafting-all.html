<h1>gardening tips -- grafting branches</h1>

<p>^^[If you think the jokes are bad, you don't know me very well.  Clearly that
is <em>your</em> fault, not mine :-)]^^</p>

<p>^^[[TOC]]^^</p>

<hr />

<p>Even people who consider themselves really good gardeners shy away from
grafting.  Wikipedia says "For successful grafting to take place, the vascular
cambium tissues of the stock and scion plants must be placed in contact with
each other. Both tissues must be kept alive until the graft has taken, usually
a period of a few weeks."  That sounds... difficult.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Grum on IRC explained to me that all that is bunkum in git.  Git
has no issues with tissues, and if Linus had to wait a few weeks for a graft
to "take", we'd still be at kernel level 2.2 or something.</p>

<p>So, here's the long and short of grafting in git.  Enjoy!  (And thank Grum
with a ++ next time you see him on #git!).</p>

<p>Note: The following description will use the word "line" to mean "a long chain
of commits with no branch or merge within it".  In <code>gitk --all</code>, it is
literally a straight line.</p>

<p><a name="concepts_grafting_connecting_two_unrelated_lines_"></a></p>

<h2>connecting two unrelated lines</h2>

<p>Let's say you have the following history, with two unrelated lines of
development (quite easily achieved by just fetching from some other repo that
has no common commits with yours!).</p>

<p>^^(By the way, how can you tell they are unrelated?  Easy -- just look at the
break in the graph connector after "a1"!)^^</p>

<pre><code>$ git log --graph '--pretty=tformat:%H %d %s %n'  --all
* 891f2a69544779e7f61a6ae2c213a3c2dc2957b1  (refs/heads/a-m) a3
|
* 6a5b7c3ba50f91630f71aeaa36e2926ea6ad42f4  a2
|
* bb1cd6894bf5a073a80fb67575adb504539fca86  a1

* b2ccb766b20061124010877b5c22e69015e0d076  (refs/heads/master) b3
|
* adec8003a1c14984a8c39fc796c1ccbac27048e0  b2
|
* c5e268659a39921d87d6d50d6d3c6eccd12f4916  b1
</code></pre>

<p>Suppose the two lines are actually of the same project, and you now want to
join them. You have decided that "b1" is the true root of the repository
(probably because that is the one that a couple of thousand people have
already cloned, and you can't change that chain ;-) and want to make the "a"
line a fork from the "b" line at the point "b1".</p>

<p>Just make a graft that says that "b1" is the parent of "a1"!  Of course you
have to use the full SHA1s, and this isn't one of the more user-friendly parts
of git, but:</p>

<pre><code>$ echo bb1cd6894bf5a073a80fb67575adb504539fca86 \
c5e268659a39921d87d6d50d6d3c6eccd12f4916 &gt; .git/info/grafts
</code></pre>

<p>So now the repo looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log --graph '--pretty=tformat:%H %d %s %n' --all
* 891f2a69544779e7f61a6ae2c213a3c2dc2957b1  (refs/heads/a-m) a3
|
* 6a5b7c3ba50f91630f71aeaa36e2926ea6ad42f4  a2
|
* bb1cd6894bf5a073a80fb67575adb504539fca86  a1
|
| * b2ccb766b20061124010877b5c22e69015e0d076  (refs/heads/master) b3
| |
| * adec8003a1c14984a8c39fc796c1ccbac27048e0  b2
|/
|
* c5e268659a39921d87d6d50d6d3c6eccd12f4916  b1
</code></pre>

<p>So far so good.  You've somehow made "a1" a child of "b1", but there's
something not quite right -- the adoption has merely been recorded on a wee
bit of notepaper, called <code>.git/info/grafts</code>.  That thing could get lost,
damaged, or whatever.  In fact, it won't even make it past a clone, leave
alone pushes and pulls.  You need to get a more formal adoption certificate,
on thick, strong, bond paper.  With the logo of the local something-or-other.
Maybe even laminated!</p>

<p>Here's how to apply for one from the district magistrate's office:</p>

<pre><code>git filter-branch --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
</code></pre>

<p>And now the repo looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log --graph '--pretty=tformat:%H %d %s %n' master a-m
* b2ccb766b20061124010877b5c22e69015e0d076  (refs/heads/master) b3
|
* adec8003a1c14984a8c39fc796c1ccbac27048e0  b2
|
| * f34c278dd638a8ade860aafb47bd7a5c8d79865b  (refs/heads/a-m) a3
| |
| * 92a7be0c15b242c8204ba86a4b5191d1492b1dd4  a2
| |
| * 941e144b19e7b0fadbd3bedc295d4e1f2441ed79  a1

|
* c5e268659a39921d87d6d50d6d3c6eccd12f4916  b1
</code></pre>

<p>Observant people will note that the SHA1 hashes for all the "a" commits have
changed, which of course they will.  The SHA1 hash for a commit is derived
from all parent commits, the current tree for that commit, the commit message,
author/committor info, and the date/time.  Since the <code>filter-branch</code> command
has made the relationship <em>permanent</em>, the SHAs for the "a"s change.</p>

<p>Even <em>more</em> observant people will notice that in the previous diagram, the
"a"s are in a straight line and the "b"s are on a "branch", while in the next
diagram they have switched places.  Topologically that's irrelevant, so don't
worry about it.</p>

<p>^^
The <em>most</em> observant people will notice that instead of <code>--all</code> I have now
passed <code>master a-m</code> (the actual branch names).  This is what you will see if
you do this with <code>--all</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ g log --graph '--pretty=tformat:%H %d %s %n'  --all

</code></pre>

<p>That's an artifact of the <code>filter-branch</code> command and git's well-known
principle of making it very hard to lose data.  If you did not like the
filter-branch for some reason, you would just:</p>

<pre><code>git checkout a-m
git reset --hard original/refs/heads/a-m
</code></pre>

<p>But if everything worked out, and the new tree looks good, you would type,
<strong>very carefully</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>rm -rf .git/refs/original/
</code></pre>

<p>That's it!

<h2>breaking a line into two...</h2>

<p>What other tricks can you get up to?</p>

<p>How about taking this:</p>

<pre><code>$ g log --graph '--pretty=tformat:%H %d %s %n'  --all

<p>and turning it into this:</p>

<p>How?  Just:</p>

<pre><code>$ echo 8e48f4975469c9c9c5de644eb8eff1e165241b09 &gt; .git/info/grafts
</code></pre>

<p>We've made "a6" what is called a "root" commit -- it has no parent.  Of
course, if you do this without giving "a5" ("a6"'s original parent) a proper
name, "a5" will become unreachable.  Which is why we gave it a name.</p>

<p><a name="concepts_grafting_and_joining_them_parallely_branch_merge__"></a></p>

<h2>...and joining them parallely (branch + merge)</h2>

<p>Or how about not just breaking them and leaving them separate, but taking the
pieces and putting them <em>parallel</em> to each other, with the tops and bottoms
joined:</p>

<p>They say gardening is the closest to playing God that God-fearing folks dare
to do :-)  Feel the power yet?</p>
