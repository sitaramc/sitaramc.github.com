<h1>all about branches and product maintenance</h1>

<p><strong>CVS/SVN folks -- please read this first</strong></p>

<p>SVN and CVS treat a branch as another subdirectory of your project.
Conversely, you can also pretend a subdirectory is a branch.  In other words,
branches (and tags) share the same namespace as the subdirectories of your
project.</p>

<p>This is not the right way to think of branches.  <strong>A branch is merely an
alternate reality for your project</strong>.  That's the simplest way to put it.
Each commit is a "snapshot" of the state of your code at a certain point in
time, and each branch (consisting of a series of commits) represents a
different timeline than the other branches do.</p>

<p>Thus, branches and subdirectories have <em>nothing</em> to do with each other.</p>

<p><a name="concepts_branches_local_and_remote_branches_"></a></p>

<h2>local and remote branches</h2>

<p>The git repository is really just a DAG (directed acyclic graph) of commits.
Each commits points to its parent or parents (merge commits have more than one
parent).  A branch in git is merely a pointer to some commit in the DAG.</p>

<p>When you checkout a branch, git simply makes your working tree look like the
files that existed when that commit was made, and makes a note that this is
your "current" branch.  When you make a commit on top of this, git updates
this current branch to point to the new "head" commit.  This is conceptually
the same as adding a new item to a linked list and moving the "head" pointer
to the new item, if you remember your data structures course from many years
ago.</p>

<p>A developer's repository will typically have several branches residing in it,
although of course only one is "checked out" at any given time into the
working tree.</p>

<p>Apart from local branches (like <code>master</code>, <code>next</code>, and maybe <code>v1.2</code>,
<code>some-new-feature</code>), etc., you will also have a set of branches called
<strong>origin/branchname</strong> (example: <code>origin/master</code>).  These are <em>your copy</em> of
the corresponding branch from the "origin" server.  You should <a href="concepts/detached-head.html">never commit
to them directly</a>.</p>

<p>And the most important thing is, you can have any other branches you wish!  Go
wild -- no one will stop you, and it's quite difficult to lose data so have
fun!</p>

<p><a name="concepts_branches_topic_branches_"></a></p>

<h2>topic branches</h2>

<p>As you read about workflows in modern VCSs, you'll often hear about topic
branches. According to the <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitglossary.html#def_topic_branch">git
glossary</a>,
a topic branch is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>A regular git branch that is used by a developer to identify a conceptual
    line of development. Since branches are very easy and inexpensive, it is
    often desirable to have several small branches that each contain very well
    defined concepts or small incremental yet related changes.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A topic branch could represent any self-contained, pretty much
independent-of-others, line of development.  A specific bug, a new feature, a
refactor, a set of enhancements to a core feature, etc., can all be managed as
topics in their own right.</p>

<p><a name="concepts_branches_product_maintenance_"></a></p>

<h2>product maintenance</h2>

<p>Let's say your version tree looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>V3---o---o---o---o---o---V4---o---o--- (master)
 \                        \
  \---o---o--- (V3maint)   \
   \                        \---o---o--- (V4maint)
    \-o--- (topicA)          \
                              \-o--- (topicB)
</code></pre>

<p>In this picture, V3 and V4 are tags representing specific versions.  V3maint
is a maintenance branch that collects ongoing fixes for V3.  These ongoing
fixes could come from commits within V3maint itself, or by integrating topic
branches such as topicA.  At various points in it's lifecycle, when things are
stable, the top commit on V3maint will be tagged V3.1, V3.2, etc., as needed.</p>

<p>(...all this applies equivalently to V4 also, of course...)</p>

<p>The "master" branch is where on-going development for the future V5 is
happening.  This "new" development may well have its own set of topic
branches, probably by feature name, but right now we'll concentrate on the
maintenance aspect of fixing bugs or making enhancements to the released
versions.</p>

<p>The simplest way to manage the flow of patches and fixes is this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>when a change is small enough to not need a topic branch, <strong><em>commit it on
the oldest branch that needs the change</em></strong>.  In this example, that could
be the V3maint or V4maint branch, depending on whether the issue affects
V3 or not.</p>

<p>Note that you <strong>cannot commit on V3</strong>.  V3 is a tag -- a tag represents a
"fixed point" in the commit hierarchy -- it's value can't change.  You can
only commit on a "branch".  In C terms, a tag is a <code>const</code> :-)</p>

<p>Also, note that although V3maint is primarily an integration branch for
the topic branches pertaining to V3, in this case it is acting as a
"catchall" topic branch for commits that are too small to have their own
topics.</p></li>
<li><p>for larger changes, create a topic branch by making a <strong><em>fork at the
oldest branch that needs this change</em></strong>.  For a bug that is applicable to
V4 but not to V3, you'd fork a topic branch at V4.  On the other hand, if
the bug applies to V3 also, you'd fork at V3.</p>

<p><em>Note</em> that you're <em>not</em> forking at V3maint or V4maint; you're forking at
V3 or V4.  See discussion in the previous bullet about V3maint's role.</p>

<p>However, it may sometimes happen that the bug does not apply to V3 but
<em>only</em> to V3maint (perhaps it's a bug that was caused by some previous fix
within the V3maint branch).  In that case, you must commit/fork it at the
current tip of V3maint.</p></li>
<li><p>Periodically <strong><em>merge the older branches into newer ones</em></strong> so the new
branches get the benefit of accumulated fixes and enhancements on the
older branches.  This means, for instance, that we merge V3maint, as well
as topic branches that forked from V3 (like topicA), into V4maint, and
then V4maint, (plus topics like topicB) into "master", which is the future
V5, etc.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The exception to these rules is if you have bugs on older versions that do not
apply to newer versions.  Merging fixes that are relevant <em>only</em> to V3, into
the V4 branch, is meaningless, and may even get you conflicts.  The way to
deal with those is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>create a new branch called, say, V3only, forked from V3</li>
<li>fixes that apply <em>only</em> to V3 go on V3only</li>
<li>fixes that apply <em>from</em> V3, to all future versions, go on V3maint</li>
<li>periodically, V3maint is merged into both V4maint as well as to V3only</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that V3only will never get merged into V4maint or V3maint, preserving the
condition that commits made in V3only are not picked up by the newer versions.</p>

<p><a name="concepts_branches_throwaway_integration_branches_"></a></p>

<h2>throwaway integration branches</h2>

<p>In all the above discussion, we kept saying "merge X into Y".  Which is all
very well if things go fine, but how do you back out if something went wrong?</p>

<p>The answer is something called a "throwaway integration branch".</p>

<p>We'll use an analogy to understand this.  Let's say you're writing a function
to insert a bunch of items into a linked list.  And let's say it's a complex
function, and at the start, you're not sure if it's going to succeed, and you
want the "head" pointer to be updated only if the whole thing succeeds.</p>

<p>How would you deal with this?  You'd make a temporary copy of the "head"
pointer, use that in your function, and if the function returns a success
value, you'd update the real "head" pointer.  Conversely, if the function
returned an error, you would leave your real "head" pointer as it is and just
discard the temporary value.</p>

<p>Git makes creating a new branch just as easy.  So instead of doing this:</p>

<pre><code>git checkout V4maint
git merge V3maint   # what if merge fails?
make test           # what if merge succeeds but tests fail?
</code></pre>

<p>where if either of the last 2 steps fail, you have to figure out how to get
back to the old V4, you do this instead:</p>

<pre><code>git branch -f test V4maint      # forcibly set test branch to V4
git checkout test               # and check it out
git merge V3maint
make test
# all good?
git branch -f V4maint test      # forcibly set V4maint to test
</code></pre>

<p>And of course if things didn't work out you would not do that last step,
preserving your V4maint at its previous revision.</p>
