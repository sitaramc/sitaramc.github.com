<strong><em>Update for git 1.7.0 and above</em></strong>
</center></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As of git 1.7.0, the default value for <code>receive.denyCurrentBranch</code> has
  changed from "warn" to "refuse".  As a result, on 1.7.0 and above, by
  default, you will not get into this sort of trouble.  However, this
  document is still useful as a detailed explanation of what precisely this
  problem is.  Just pretend, as you read along, that you're on a pre-1.7.0
  system or that someone set <code>receive.denyCurrentBranch</code> to "warn", "ignore"
  or 'false'.</p>

<h2>what is a bare repo?</h2>

<p>A bare repository is a concept that is sort of unique to a Distributed VCS
like git (and, I presume, other such DVCSs like Hg/Bzr/etc also).</p>

<p>A normal git repository is a directory that contains</p>

<ul>
<li>project directories and files (the "working tree" mentioned above)</li>
<li>a single directory called <code>.git</code> containing all of git's
administrative and control files; we'll call it the <strong>magic</strong> directory
because git can't do any magic without it :-)</li>
</ul>

<p>When you do a <code>git status</code> inside such a directory, git looks inside the
"magic" directory, compares your current working tree with the "current
branch" as recorded in the magic directory, and tells you what files have
changed, etc etc.</p>

<p>A "bare" repo, as the git
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitglossary.html">glossary</a>
says, is a repository that does not contain a "working tree" at all.  It
doesn't contain the special <code>.git</code> sub-directory either; instead, it
contains all the contents of the <code>.git</code> subdirectory right in the main
directory itself.</p>

<p><a name="concepts_bare_yeah_yeah_but_why_do_I_need_a_bare_repo__"></a></p>

<h2>yeah yeah, but <strong>why</strong> do I need a bare repo?</h2>

<p>ok; demo time...</p>

<p>Let's try creating a small repo, adding a file, committing, and checking
<code>git status</code>:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir a; cd a; git init
echo hi &gt; a;git add a; git commit -m a
git status
</code></pre>

<p>This should respond</p>

<pre><code># On branch master
# nothing to commit (working directory clean)
</code></pre>

<p>So far so good.  Now someone clones our repository, adds a new file, commits,
and pushes his changes back to our repository:</p>

<pre><code>cd ..;git clone a b
cd b; echo there &gt;&gt; b; git add b; git commit -m b
git push
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>git push</code> above sends your new commits to the "origin" repository.  More
specifically, it updates the "magic" directory on repo "a" with this new
commit.</p>

<p>Now you go back to the main repo and check <code>git status</code></p>

<pre><code>cd ../a
git status
</code></pre>

<p>which responds</p>

<pre><code># On branch master
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
#
#       deleted:    b
</code></pre>

<p>Whoa!  What happened here?  We <strong>added</strong> a file called <code>b</code> in the cloned
repository and pushed to the "origin".  But your origin now claims you
<strong>deleted</strong> that file...?</p>

<p>To understand this, you need to realise that <strong>the "magic" directory is always
assumed to be correct</strong>; it is the "standard" against which your working tree
is compared to determine what changes you made in your working tree.</p>

<p>So when you asked for a status, git first looked inside the magic directory.
The magic directory said you should have two files, "a" and "b", but your work
tree has only file "a".  So <code>git status</code> concludes that you have deleted
the file "b"!</p>

<p>In other words, when someone changes the "magic" directory <strong>behind your
back</strong>, your locally checked out copy (your working tree) appears to have the
<strong>opposite</strong> changes made by you.</p>

<p>All this confusion can (and <em>should</em>) be avoided by using a "bare"
repository to clone and pull from, and push to.  It doesn't have a checked out
tree, so it just does what the "server" notionally does in a centralised VCS
-- records commits, branches, etc when you push to it, and gives you the
latest versions when you clone or pull from it.</p>

<p><a name="concepts_bare_how_do_I_fix_such_a_non_bare_push__"></a></p>

<h2>how do I fix such a non-bare push?</h2>

<p>If you did push into a non-bare repo, the first thing to do is make sure that
no one is working on that checked out work tree, and no local changes have
been made since the last checkout.</p>

<p>Once you've made sure of that, you should log onto that machine, cd to that
repo, and do this:</p>

<pre><code>git reset --hard HEAD
</code></pre>

<p>If you had local changes on that work tree, or you are not sure if you had
any, then you have a bit of a challenge.  There are ways to deal with it quite
nicely in git, but I haven't tried them yet.  Ideas:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>see if any of the HEADs in reflog match your current work tree exactly, in
which case you really do NOT have any local changes, and you can safely do
that reset.  Use <code>git reflog show your-branch-name</code> to find the topmost
commit after the most recent push or set of pushes (in case there were
more than one) and compare your work tree against that.</p>

<p>Let's say your reflog output looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ git reflog show master
fcbb5a7 master@{0}: push
e41b4ce master@{1}: push
6ef3360 master@{2}: commit: blah blah more blah
a48b324 master@{3}: commit: blah blah blah
48e4b98 master@{4}: commit (initial): first commit
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, there were two "behind your back" pushes, and it is very
likely that master@{2} is the "base" for your current work tree.  So you
compare against that:</p>

<pre><code>$ git diff --stat --exit-code master@{2}
</code></pre>

<p>If there are no differences, you're probably OK to do that <code>git reset
--hard</code>.  If you're really paranoid, you'll check to make sure that
master@{2} is an ancestor of HEAD:</p>

<pre><code>git rev-list HEAD..master@{2}   # should be empty
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>anyway, if the diff above showed differences, you have a merge of some
sort coming up.  Here's what you do:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>make a temporary branch off that same commit</p>

<pre><code>git checkout -b temp master@{2}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>now you have two alternatives:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The safe way: commit those changes.  If the work is not complete,
complete it -- you have all the time in the world now that you have
created a temp branch, and any number of pushes can now happen on
'master' without affecting you, since it isn't the checked out branch.</p></li>
<li><p>The quicker way: stash those changes using <code>git stash</code>.  I am 99% sure
stashing will work as well here, but would appreciate hearing from any
git.experts reading this (email me at sitaramc@gmail.com)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>now checkout master and either merge temp or <code>git stash pop</code> depending
on which option you chose above; it's just a normal branch now!</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p><a name="concepts_bare_how_do_I_prevent_the_problem_from_happening_again__"></a></p>

<h2>how do I prevent the problem from happening again?</h2>

<p>The best option is upgrade to git 1.7.0 or later!</p>

<p>If you cannot upgrade, and if you or others will continue to push into this
repo, you have to make it a bare repo.</p>

<p>To make it a "real" bare repo, just delete all the files except <code>.git</code>, then
<code>mv .git/* .; rmdir .git</code>.  Finally, edit the file called <code>config</code> and change
<code>bare = false</code> to <code>bare = true</code>.</p>

<p>If you're not comfortable playing with git at that level, there is another
alternative.  You may have guessed by now that you can make a non-bare repo
look like a bare repo for push purposes by creating and checking out a branch
that your users will not push to.  The entire repo does not have to be bare,
really...</p>

<p>So just run <code>git checkout -b DUMMY_BRANCH_DONT_USE</code> (or some such name) and
keep this branch checked out forever in this repo.  This is a cheap way to
make a non-bare repo into a bare repo for all practical purposes.</p>
