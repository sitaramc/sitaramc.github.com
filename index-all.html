<h1>(READ THIS FIRST) README for the git-notes repo</h1>

<p>This repo contains all my notes about git.  I started writing them for my own
understanding, almost like cheat sheets, but they may be useful for others
also.</p>

<p>Git is a <strong>Distributed</strong> Version Control System.  Most VCSs you know (like
CVS, Subversion, Clearcase, Perforce, and VSS) are centralised.  A Distributed
VCS allows you to make frequent, local, commits to checkpoint your work while
you're still perfecting the code -- you cannot do this with a centralised VCS.</p>

<h2>Basics</h2>

<p><font color="red">If you...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>have <strong>no idea what git is</strong> and wonder what the fuss is all about, and
why it's become so popular, see <a href="other-stuff/git-lfy.html">this article</a>,
which I wrote for LFY (July 2008 issue)</p></li>
<li><p>want a basic intro to the most important concepts behind git, see <a href="1-basic-usage/intro.html">this
presentation</a></p></li>
<li><p>know something about version control, and are trying to understand <strong>why
git is so powerful</strong>, spend some time on <a href="other-stuff/gittalk.html">this
presentation</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>need a quick refresh of the terminology once in a while, read
<a href="concepts/0-terminology.html">this</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>if you're itching to get started, but have become overwhelmed by having to
understand git itself and how it fits with ssh or http etc., read
<a href="1-basic-usage/simple-git-session.html">this</a> -- I've been told it is
quite helpful :)</p></li>
</ul>

<p></font></p>

<p>Note that the presentations are meant to be interactive, with someone talking
through the slides, but have enough detail that you can read them yourself if
you like.</p>
