<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: In the following description, &quot;user&quot; means &quot;user or a <a href="groups.html">group</a> that he/she is a member of&quot;, and &quot;repo&quot; means &quot;repo, or a group that it is a member of, or a (<a href="wild.html">wild</a> repo) pattern that matches it, or a group that contains a pattern that matches it&quot;.</p>
<h1 id="what-do-rules-look-like"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> what do rules look like</h1>
<p>Here's an example ruleset.</p>
<pre><code>@staff          =   dilbert alice wally bob

repo foo
    RW+         =   dilbert     # line 1
    RW+ dev     =   alice       # line 2
    -           =   wally       # line 3
    RW  temp/   =   @staff      # line 4
    R           =   ashok       # line 5</code></pre>
<p>A rule line has the structure</p>
<pre><code>&lt;permission&gt; &lt;zero or more refexes&gt; = &lt;one or more users/user groups&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The most commonly used permissions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>R, for read only</li>
<li>RW, for push existing ref or create new ref</li>
<li>RW+, for &quot;push -f&quot; or ref deletion allowed (i.e., destroy information)</li>
<li><code>-</code> (the minus sign), to <strong>deny</strong> access.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also other, less commonly used, <a href="write-types.html">types of permissions</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="refex.html">refex</a> is an expression that matches the ref (i.e., branch or tag) being pushed.</p>
<p><font color="gray">You can also use <a href="vref.html">virtual refs</a> to perform extra checks and controls that you can't do with just the normal ref (like refs/heads/master) being pushed. The most common example is restricting pushes by dir/file name, but there are lots of other possibilities.</font></p>
<h1 id="how-are-the-rules-checked"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> how are the rules checked</h1>
<p>Note that gitolite first <a href="rules.html#rule-accum">accumulates the rules</a> before checking access.</p>
<h2 id="read-access----clone-fetch-archive"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> read access -- clone, fetch, archive</h2>
<p>Read access is checked only once, just before passing control to git-upload-pack or git-archive-pack. At this point gitolite only knows the repo name, the user name, and the fact that it is a read operation.</p>
<p>Here's the default flow:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>go through the <a href="rules.html#rule-accum">accumulated</a> rules for the repo in the sequence they appear in the conf file</p></li>
<li>for each rule:
<ul>
<li>skip the rule if it does not apply to this user</li>
<li>if the rule contains an &quot;R&quot; (i.e., it is &quot;R&quot;, &quot;RW&quot;, or any variant of &quot;RW&quot;), allow access and stop checking rules</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If no rule ends with a decision, (&quot;fallthru&quot;), deny access</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="refex.html">refex</a> field is ignored for this check. (Git does not support distinguishing one ref from another for access control during read operations).</p>
<h3 id="deny-rules"><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> read access respecting deny rules</h3>
<p>When the ref is not known, deny rules (the &quot;-&quot; permission) are ignored by default. In our example, line 3 does not prevent wally from cloning the repo, because line 4 permits it.</p>
<table><tr><td width="15%" class="box gray">

<p><strong>TIP</strong></p>
<p>When is the ref not known?</p>
<p>It is not known for read access. For write access, the ref is not known during the &quot;pre-git&quot; access check, i.e., before we call git-receive-pack.</p>
</td><td>

<p>You can change that by using the <code>deny-rules</code> <a href="options.html">option</a>. If this option is active for a repo then this is the flow for access checking:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>go through the <a href="rules.html#rule-accum">accumulated</a> rule list for the repo in the sequence they appear in the conf file</p></li>
<li>for each rule:
<ul>
<li>skip the rule if it does not apply to this user</li>
<li>if it's a deny rule, deny access and stop checking rules</li>
<li>if the rule contains an &quot;R&quot; (i.e., it is &quot;R&quot;, &quot;RW&quot;, or any variant of &quot;RW&quot;), allow access and stop checking rules</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If no rule ends with a decision, (&quot;fallthru&quot;), deny access</p></li>
</ul>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Apart from the extra check for deny rules, there is another very subtle but important difference here: the order of the rules matters now, where previously it did not.</p>
<p>Later in this document are a couple of <a href="rules.html#deny-rules-ex">examples</a> showing this option in use.</p>
<h2 id="write-access----push"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> write access -- push</h2>
<p>Write access is checked twice, once before passing control to git-receive-pack, and once from within the update hook.</p>
<p>The first check is identical to the one for read access, except of course the permission field must contain a &quot;W&quot;. As before, deny rules are ignored, and you can override that using the <a href="rules.html#deny-rules">deny-rules</a> option. The <a href="refex.html">refex</a> field is also ignored, because at this point we don't know what refs are going to be pushed.</p>
<p>The <strong>second check</strong> happens from within the update hook. Deny rules <em>are</em> considered, which in turn means the <em>sequence</em> of the rules matters.</p>
<p>Also, this time, git supplies us with three more pieces of information: the name of the ref being updated (like &quot;refs/heads/master&quot;), the old SHA, and the new SHA. This information is sufficient to determine whether this is a normal push or a forced, (a.k.a rewind), push. A normal push requires the permission field to contain a &quot;W&quot;, while a forced push requires it to contain a &quot;+&quot;.</p>
<p>Here's how the actual rule matching happens:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>go through the <a href="rules.html#rule-accum">accumulated</a> rule list for the repo in the sequence they appear in the conf file</p></li>
<li>for each rule:
<ul>
<li>skip the rule if it does not apply to this user</li>
<li>If the ref does not match the <a href="refex.html">refex</a>, skip the rule</li>
<li>If it's a deny rule, deny access and stop checking rules</li>
<li>If the permission field matches the specific <a href="write-types.html">type of write</a> operation, allow access and stop checking rules</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If no rule ends with a decision, (&quot;fallthru&quot;), deny access</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Now all you need is to understand how <a href="refex.html">refex</a> matching happens and how the permissions match the various <a href="write-types.html">types of write operations</a>.</p>
<h2 id="rule-info"><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> <span class="gray">(v3.6+)</span> tracing rule flow (debugging rules)</h2>
<p>If you've tried reading all this and still have trouble with rules, you can use the 'gitolite access' command (directly on the server) to help.</p>
<p>The access command's '-s' option helps debug rule flow. Like all gitolite commands, it responds to a single argument of '-h' with a reasonably detailed usage message if you need some more details.</p>
<h1 id="permsum"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> summary of permissions</h1>
<p>The full set of permissions, in regex syntax, is <code>-|R|RW+?C?D?M?</code>. This expands to one of <code>-</code>, <code>R</code>, <code>RW</code>, <code>RW+</code>, <code>RWC</code>, <code>RW+C</code>, <code>RWD</code>, <code>RW+D</code>, <code>RWCD</code>, or <code>RW+CD</code>, all but the first two optionally followed by an <code>M</code>. And by now you know what they all mean.</p>
<h1 id="additional-topics"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> additional topics</h1>
<h2 id="rule-accum"><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> rule accumulation</h2>
<p>Gitolite was meant to collect rules from multiple places and apply them all in sequence. For example, if you have the following (we've added line numbers to aid later explanation):</p>
<pre><code> 1  # we have 3 specifically named FOSS projects, but we also consider any
 2  # project in the foss/ directory to be FOSS.
 3  @FOSS-projects  =   git gitolite linux foss/..*

 4  # similarly for proprietary projects
 5  @prop-projects  =   foo bar baz prop/..*

 6  # our users are divided into staff, interns, and bosses
 7  @staff          =   alice dilbert wally
 8  @interns        =   ashok
 9  @bosses         =   PHB

10  # we have certain policies.  The first is that FOSS projects are readable
11  # by everyone
12  repo @FOSS-projects
13      R   =   @all

14  # the second is that bosses can read any repo if they wish to
15  repo @all
16      R   =   @bosses

17  # now we have specific rules for specific projects
18  repo git
19      RW+ =   junio
20      ...some other rules...

21  repo gitolite
22      RW+ =   sitaram
23      ...some other rules...

24  ...etc...</code></pre>
<p>the <strong>effective</strong> rule list for, say, the &quot;gitolite&quot; repo will be (keeping the line numbers the same so you know where they are coming from):</p>
<pre><code>13      R   =   @all            # since it is a member of @FOSS-projects
16      R   =   @bosses         # since every repo is a member of @all anyway
22      RW+ =   sitaram         # from the gitolite-specific ruleset
23      ...some other rules...  # from the gitolite-specific ruleset</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, for each user+repo combination, several rules will apply. Gitolite combines them all into one list (in the sequence they are found in the conf file), before applying the access checks.</p>
<p>This extends to patterns also. For example, if you have this:</p>
<pre><code>repo foss/apache
    ...some rules...</code></pre>
<p>then, because this repo fits the pattern <code>foss/..*</code>, it is considered part of the <span class="citation">@FOSS-projects</span> group, so all the rules that apply to that group are in play when someone accesses foss/apache.</p>
<p>This is what we meant by &quot;repo, or a group that it is a member of, or a (<a href="wild.html">wild</a> repo) pattern that matches it, or a group that contains a pattern that matches it&quot;, up at the top of this document.</p>
<h2 id="deny-rules-ex"><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> examples of deny rules</h2>
<p><strong>example 1</strong></p>
<pre><code> 1  @secret = gitolite-admin secret-repo/one secret-repo/two [...]

 2  # put this at or near the top of the conf file, or at least before any
 3  # rules that give 'gitweb' and 'daemon' any kind of access
 4  repo @secret
 5      -   =   gitweb daemon
 6      option deny-rules = 1
 7      # make sure you do not set deny-rules to 0 for these repos later

 8  repo @all
 9      R   =   gitweb daemon

10  &lt;...other rules...&gt;</code></pre>
<p>In this example, we have lots of repos, which should all be accessible by gitweb or daemon, so we want the convenience provided by lines 8 and 9 (we don't want to put line 9 in <em>each</em> repo). However, we also have some secret repos (maybe the gitolite-admin repo and some others), which we want to prevent gitweb or daemon from seeing, and which we are able to list explicitly in some way.</p>
<p>Therefore we apply the &quot;deny-rules&quot; option to just those repos, and ensure that the first rule encountered by these two &quot;users&quot; for those repos is a deny rule. This makes gitolite deny read access to those users for those repos.</p>
<p><strong>example 2</strong></p>
<p>In this example the &quot;open&quot; repos are fewer in number, so it is the opposite situation to the above in terms of our ability to enumerate all the repos.</p>
<pre><code>@open = git gitolite foss/..* [...]

# put this at or near the top of the conf file, or at least before any
# rules that give 'gitweb' and 'daemon' any access
repo @all
    -   =   gitweb daemon
    option deny-rules = 1

repo @open
    R   =   gitweb daemon
    option deny-rules = 0
    # make sure you do not set deny-rules to 1 for these repos later</code></pre>
<p>To see why this works, you need to remember that for <a href="options.html">options</a> and <a href="git-config.html">config</a> lines, a later setting <a href="git-config.html#override_conf">overrides</a> earlier ones. So we set it to 1 for all repos, then selectively set it to 0 for some.</p>
<p>This means the &quot;deny-rules&quot; option applies to <em>all the repos except the &quot;open&quot; repos</em>. For such repos, the first rule encountered by gitweb and daemon is a deny rule, so they are denied read access.</p>
