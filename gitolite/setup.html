<h1>setting up gitolite</h1>

<p>This is the second step in using gitolite, after <a href="install.html">install</a>.  This also
happens on the server,  (The next step is <a href="clone.html">clone</a>).</p>

<hr />

<p>Installing the software gets you ready to use it, but the first "use" of it is
always the "setup" command.</p>

<p>The first time you run it, you need to have a public key file (usually from
the admin's workstation) ready.  If the main gitolite admin's username is
"alice", this file should be named "alice.pub".  Then, as the <a href="install.html#nnc">hosting
user</a>, run:</p>

<pre><code>gitolite setup -pk alice.pub
</code></pre>

<p>If that command completes without any warnings, you should be done.  If it had
a warning, you probably supplied a key which already has shell access to the
server.  That won't work.</p>

<blockquote>
  <hr />
  
  <p>Normally, gitolite is hosted on a user that no one accesses directly --
    you log on to the server using some other userid, and then <code>su - git</code>.  In
    this scenario, there <em>is</em> no key being used for shell access, so there is
    no conflict.</p>
  
  <p>An alternative method is to use two different keys, and a <a href="sts.html#ssh-ha">host
    alias</a> to distinguish the two.</p>
  
  <p><a href="emergencies.html#ce">common errors</a> has some links to background information on this
    issue.</p>
  
  <hr />
</blockquote>

<p>The 'setup' command has other uses, so you will be running it at other times
after the install as well:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>To setup the update hook when you move <a href="rare.html#existing">existing</a> repos to gitolite.
This also applies if someone has been fiddling with the hooks on some
repos and you want to put them all right quickly.</p></li>
<li><p>To replace a <a href="emergencies.html#lost-key">lost admin key</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>To setup gitolite for http mode (run 'gitolite setup -h' for more info).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>When in doubt, run 'gitolite setup' anyway; it doesn't do any harm, though it
may take a minute or so if you have more than a few thousand repos!</p>
