<h1 id="accessing-gitolite"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> accessing gitolite</h1>
<p>The most common setup is based on ssh, where your admin asks you to send him your public key, and uses that to setup your access.</p>
<p>Your actual access is either a git command (like <code>git clone git@server:reponame</code>, and we won't be discussing these any more in this document), or an ssh command (like <code>ssh git@server info</code>).</p>
<p>Note that you do <em>not</em> get a shell on the server -- the whole point of gitolite is to prevent that!</p>
<p><strong>Note to people (*) who think gitolite requires or can only handle a specific syntax of URL</strong>: Gitolite is designed in such a way that, unless there is an access violation, the <em>client</em> need not even <em>know</em> that something called gitolite is sitting between it and git on the server. In particular, this means <em>any</em> URL syntax listed in 'man git-clone' for ssh and/or http will work. The only things to note are:</p>
<ul>
<li>in ssh mode, you <em>must</em> use key-based authentication (i.e., passwords won't work; see the <a href="ssh.html">ssh</a> documents for why)</li>
<li>the path of the repo is what you put into the conf file (e.g., &quot;testing&quot;, and not &quot;repositories/testing&quot; or &quot;/home/git/repositories/testing&quot; or such). A good rule of thumb is to use the exact name the <code>info</code> command (see below) shows you.</li>
<li>the &quot;.git&quot; at the end is optional for <strong>git</strong> commands (i.e., you can use &quot;testing.git&quot; instead of &quot;testing&quot; for clone, fetch, push, etc., if you like) but <strong>gitolite</strong> commands in general (see below) will not like the additional &quot;.git&quot; at the end.</li>
</ul>
<p><font color="gray">(*): A curious, but decidedly non-scientific, observation: this appears to happen mostly to Mac people; I don't recall many Windows people getting confused, and almost none who use Unix doing so).</font></p>
<h1 id="info"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> the info command</h1>
<p>The only command that is <em>always</em> available to every user is the <code>info</code> command (run <code>ssh git@host info -h</code> for help), which tells you what version of gitolite and git are on the server, and what repositories you have access to. The list of repos is very useful if you have doubts about the spelling of some new repo that you know was setup.</p>
<h1 id="digression-two-kinds-of-repos"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> digression: two kinds of repos</h1>
<p>Gitolite has two kinds of repos. Normal repos are specified by their full names in the config file. &quot;Wildcard&quot; repos are specified by a regex in the config file. Try the <a href="user.html#info"><code>info</code> command</a> and see if it shows any lines that look like regex patterns, (with a &quot;C&quot; permission).</p>
<p>If you see any, it means you are allowed to create brand new repos whose names fit that pattern. When you create such a repo, your &quot;ownership&quot; of it (as far as gitolite is concerned) is automatically recorded by gitolite.</p>
<h1 id="other-commands"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> other commands</h1>
<h2 id="perms"><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> set/get additional permissions for repos you created</h2>
<p>The gitolite config may have several permissions lines for your repo, like so:</p>
<pre><code>repo pub/CREATOR/..*
    C       =   ...some list of users allowed to create repos...
    RW+     =   CREATOR
    RW      =   user1 user2
    R       =   user3</code></pre>
<p>If that's all it had, you really can't do much. Any changes to access must be done by the administrator. (Note that &quot;CREATOR&quot; is a reserved word that gets expanded to your userid in some way, so the admin can literally add just the first three lines, and <em>every</em> authenticated user now has his own personal repo namespace, starting with <code>pub/&lt;username&gt;/</code>).</p>
<p>To give some flexibility to users, the admin could add rules like this:</p>
<pre><code>    RW      =   WRITERS
    R       =   READERS</code></pre>
<p>(he could also add other <a href="wild.html#roles">roles</a> but then he needs to read the documentation).</p>
<p>Once he does this, you can then use the <code>perms</code> command (run <code>ssh git@host perms -h</code> for help) to set permissions for other users by specifying which users are in the list of &quot;READERS&quot;, and which in &quot;WRITERS&quot;.</p>
<p>If you think of READERS and WRITERS as &quot;roles&quot;, it will help. You can't change what access a role has, but you <em>can</em> say which users have that role.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: there isn't a way for you to see the actual rule set unless you're given read access to the special 'gitolite-admin' repo. Sorry. The idea is that your admin will tell you what &quot;roles&quot; he added into rules for your repos, and what permissions those roles have.</p>
<h2 id="desc"><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> adding a description to repos you created</h2>
<p>The <code>desc</code> command is extremely simple. Run <code>ssh git@host desc -h</code> for help.</p>
<h1 id="site-local-commands"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> &quot;site-local&quot; commands</h1>
<p>The main purpose of gitolite is to prevent you from getting a shell. But there are commands that you often need to run on the server (i.e., cannot be done by pushing something to a repo).</p>
<p>To enable this, gitolite allows the admin to setup scripts in a special directory that users can then run. Gitolite comes with a set of working scripts that your admin may install, or may use as a starting point for his own, if he chooses.</p>
<p>Think of these commands as equivalent to those in <code>COMMAND_DIR</code> in <code>man git-shell</code>.</p>
<p>You can get a list of available commands by running <code>ssh git@host help</code>.</p>
