<h1>how does gitolite work</h1>

<p>You'll appreciate this more if you first read the <a href="http://sitaramc.github.com/1-basic-usage/tias.html">try it and see</a> page
(don't worry, it's very short and quick).</p>

<h2>what does a "gitolite repo" look like?</h2>

<p>A gitolite repo looks just like a normal bare repo on any normal git server.
There are a few extra files placed in the repo directory whose names start
with "gl-", and there is also an update hook placed in the hooks subdirectory,
but that's about it, for the most part.</p>

<p>In other words, you can treat a gitolite-managed repo just like any other bare
repo as long as you leave those files alone.</p>

<h2>conventions used</h2>

<pre><code>--//--&gt;     network connection
------&gt;     exec() or system() call
--??--&gt;     conditional exec() or system() call
</code></pre>

<p>"Conditional" means some checks done by the caller may result in caller
deciding not to make the call and abort instead.</p>

<h2>git over plain ssh</h2>

<p>If you have used rsync or any similar program with a remote host using ssh,
then you already understand the basics of git over ssh.</p>

<p>Here is a little more detail on what is happening:</p>

<pre><code># for read operations
git clone ------&gt; ssh --//--&gt; sshd ------&gt; git-upload-pack
git fetch ------&gt; ssh --//--&gt; sshd ------&gt; git-upload-pack

# for write operations
git push  ------&gt; ssh --//--&gt; sshd ------&gt; git-receive-pack
</code></pre>

<p>The local git client just runs something like <code>ssh git@host git-receive-pack
'path/to/reponame.git'</code> (using the push example), and when that connection is
established the local git-push and the remote git-receive-pack communicate
over this connection.</p>

<h2>git over gitolite</h2>

<p>Installing gitolite only adds an extra layer in between the sshd and the
git-receive-pack (or git-upload-pack, for read operations), to check if the
access is allowed and abort if needed.</p>

<p>Using the push as an example, this is what it looks like:</p>

<pre><code>git push  ------&gt; ssh --//--&gt; sshd ------&gt; gitolite-shell --??--&gt; git-receive-pack
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the git <em>client</em> does not change at all; in fact it doesn't even
know that something called gitolite exists!</p>

<p>Here's how we get the server side behaviour shown above:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>we make sshd invoke 'gitolite-shell', even though the git client asked it
to invoke 'git-receive-pack' (or 'git-upload-pack' for reads).</p></li>
<li><p>we also make sshd supply an argument to 'gitolite-shell'.  This is the
name of the gitolite user.  (Remember this is a virtual user, not a real
"unix" userid).</p></li>
<li><p>finally, sshd itself supplies the original command that the git <em>client</em>
wanted to run (<code>git-receive-pack 'path/to/reponame.git'</code>) in a special
environment variable called <code>SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>(<font color="gray">All this is done using various ssh features; see the
<a href="glssh.html">gitolite and ssh</a> page for details</font>).</p>

<h3>gitolite-shell</h3>

<p>So gitolite-shell has two pieces of information.  From argument-1 it knows the
username, and from that env var it knows what repo and what operation (i.e.,
is it a read or a write) is requested.</p>

<p>At this point, it checks the user's access and decides if the access is
allowed or not.</p>

<p>(<font color="gray">For details see the <a href="rules.html">rules</a> page, especially the
sections "when are the rules checked" and "how are the rules matched"</font>).</p>

<p>For read operations this is the end of gitolite's interference.  If the access
is allowed, git-upload-pack runs, does its job, and exits.</p>

<h3>update hook</h3>

<p>For write operations, git itself runs an update hook, if one is available,
before allowing the ref to be updated.  All of gitolite's "fine-grained access
control" happens via this hook, which gitolite installs on every repo that it
is managing.</p>

<p>When git calls the update hook, it supplies 3 critical pieces of information
as arguments.  Together with what we already know (user, repo), these 3 pieces
of information (refname being updated, the old SHA, and the new SHA) tell us
all we need to implement whatever access control you want to, like "only alice
and dilbert can push the master branch", "wally can only push branches
starting with 'wally/'", or "only dilbert can push changes to 'license.txt',
etc.</p>

<p>(<font color="gray">Again, details are in the <a href="rules.html">rules</a> page</font>).</p>
