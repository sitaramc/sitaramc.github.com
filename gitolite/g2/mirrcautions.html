<h3>IMPORTANT cautions</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>For reasons given in the 'discussion' section later, the mirroring process
will never <em>create</em> a repo on the receiving side.  It has to exist, and be
willing to accept pushes from the master.</p>

<p>In particular, this means that repositories created by end-users ("wild"
repos) <em>need to be explicitly created</em> on the mirror (preferably by the
same user, assuming his ssh key works there as well).  Once the repo has
been created on the slave, subsequent pushes will be mirrored correctly.</p></li>
<li><p>This process will <em>only</em> mirror your git repositories, using <code>git push
--mirror</code>.  It will <em>not</em> mirror log files, and repo-specific files like
<code>gl-creater</code> and <code>gl-perms</code> files, or indeed anything that was manually
created or added (for example, custom config entries added manually
instead of via gitolite).</p>

<p>None of these affect actual repo contents of course, but they could be
important, (especially the gl-creator, although if your wildcard pattern
had "CREATOR" in it you can recreate those files easily enough anyway).</p></li>
<li><p>This document has been tested using a 3-server setup, all installed using
the <em>non-root</em> method (see doc/1-INSTALL.mkd).  However, the process is
probably not going to be very forgiving of human error -- like anything
that is this deep in "system admin" territory, errors are likely to be
costly.  If you're the kind who hits enter first and then thinks about
what he typed, you're in for some fun times ;-)</p>

<p>On the plus side, everything we do is done using git commands, so things
are never <em>really</em> lost until you do a <code>git gc</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Mirroring has <em>not</em> been, and will not be, tested with gitolite installed
using the deprecated 'from-client' method.  Please use one of the other
methods.</p></li>
<li><p>Also, this has <em>not</em> been tested with smart-http.  I'm not even sure it'll
work; http is very fiddly to get right.  If you want mirroring, at least
your server-to-server comms should be over ssh.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, this method uses repo-specific <code>git config</code> variables to store
the mirroring information.  Please read the <strong>WARNING</strong> in the
documentation on <a href="confother_.html#rsgc" title="repo specific `git config` commands">git config commands</a> if you wish to <strong>delete</strong> one
of those lines.</p></li>
</ul>
