<h1>virtual refs and scoring</h1>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT: UNTIL THIS NOTICE IS REMOVED, THESE FEATURES ARE ONLY AVAILABLE
IN THE "vrs" BRANCH</strong>.  If you want it in "pu" you need to use "vrs" for some
time, test it as well as you can, and tell me it works for you.  The more
people do that, the faster it moves to "pu" (hint hint!)</p>

<p>There are 2 distinct topics covered here, but they're related because the
second one depends on the first.  Since both are complex in their own right, I
gave them their own document rather than dump it somewhere in
doc/gitolite.conf.mkd.</p>

<p>This is advanced magic.  If you need every step explained or written down with
exact commands, this is not for you; sorry.</p>

<p><a name="virtualrefs_and_scoring_real_refs_virtual_refs_and_reftypes_"></a></p>

<h2>real refs, virtual refs, and reftypes</h2>

<p>So far, you've seen access control that works based on what branch or tag
you're trying to push.  This is called a "ref", in git terms, and looks like
<code>refs/heads/master</code> or <code>refs/tags/v2.0rc1</code>.  <strong>We call this a "real" ref</strong>.</p>

<p>But suppose you want to prevent a push based on other conditions.  Typically,
you want to limit the "damage" a well-meaning but inexpert junior dev can do.
Here're some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>prevent pushing changes to specific, critical, files (e.g., <code>Makefile</code>)</li>
<li>prevent adding new files by file "type" (perhaps using the <code>file</code> command)</li>
<li>prevent files larger than a certain size to be added</li>
<li>prevent pushes that affect more than a certain number of files</li>
<li>allow some actions only if coming from an internal IP (perceived to be
more secure perhaps)</li>
<li>prevent some actions if coming in via httpd (instead of ssh)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you think about it, each of these is a characteristic of the push, just
like <code>refs/heads/master</code> is.  You can treat them all as "ref"s of some kind,
so <strong>we call them "virtual" refs, each of a different "reftype"</strong>.</p>

<p>Solutions to each of the above examples, in order, might look like this.
(Note that this is not a usable ruleset; each line is independent and is
merely showing the syntax):</p>

<pre><code>-   VR_NAME/Makefile    =   @junior_devs
-   VR_TYPE/relocatable =   @junior_devs
-   VR_SIZE/500000      =   @junior_devs
-   VR_COUNT/10         =   @junior_devs
RW+ VR_IP/172\.25\.     =   @junior_devs
-   VR_VIA/http         =   @junior_devs
</code></pre>

<p>Only NAME, SIZE, and COUNT have been implemented.  You can implement and
maintain your own virtual refs without touching the main gitolite code base,
so if you end up implementing one of the others please contribute.</p>

<h3>side notes</h3>

<p><a name="virtualrefs_and_scoring_who_needs_this__"></a></p>

<h4>who needs this?</h4>

<p>Have you ever had a junior dev make a sweeping whitespace or cr/lf change and
commit the whole darn thing?  Or added a large "core" file by mistake?</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, most of these restrictions can be done by forcing junior
devs to use their own branches and someone manually checking their commits
before merging them into one of the main branches.</p>

<p>However, that creates work for the senior devs, plus they might miss something
if they're checking manually.  Automation is good...</p>

<p><a name="virtualrefs_and_scoring_number_of_refs_returned_"></a></p>

<h4>number of refs returned</h4>

<p>Notice above that NAME (and TYPE, if someone implements it) will usually
return more than one "ref".  After all, you do change more than one file in a
push.  However, SIZE (size of largest new file added), COUNT, and IP return
only one value -- there can only be one "answer" to the question they're
asking.</p>

<h3>installing virtual refs</h3>

<p>Virtual refs do not get installed automatically.  You have to install them
yourself.  The ones that ship with gitolite can be found in <code>contrib/vr/</code>; you
need to copy them to <code>src/</code> and then install/upgrade gitolite.  Or you can
place them directly on the server after a normal gitolite install.  It doesn't
matter how you do it; in the end they need to be in the same directory as
<code>gl-auth-command</code> and all the rest of the scripts.</p>

<p><a name="virtualrefs_and_scoring_adding_your_own_virtual_refs_"></a></p>

<h3>adding your own virtual refs</h3>

<p>All virtual refs start with <code>VR_</code>.  Adding a new virtual ref called <code>VR_FOO</code>
consists of creating a script (in any language) called <code>VR_FOO</code> that takes 5
arguments and prints a "match type" and a newline separate list of "refs".
See <code>VR_COUNT</code> for details; that script implements the COUNT virtual ref and
also serves as documentation on writing VR scripts.</p>

<p><a name="virtualrefs_and_scoring_passing_simple_arguments_to_the_VR_script_"></a></p>

<h3>passing simple arguments to the VR script</h3>

<p>If you think about it, a rule like </p>

<pre><code>-   VR_NAME/Makefile    @interns
</code></pre>

<p>can have several interpretations.  The simplest (and the one we use) is: "does
<code>git diff $oldsha $newsha</code> contain a file called <code>Makefile</code>?  If it does, do
not let an intern push the commit chain".</p>

<p>However, this means such an intern can <em>never</em> create a personal branch based
off of some existing branch (as described <a href="tnconv_.html#pers" title="&quot;personal&quot; branches">here</a>), which sorta defeats
the purpose of having personal branches, no?</p>

<p>If all he did was <code>git checkout -b priv/ashok/my-master master; git push
origin HEAD</code>, is that really the same as touching the Makefile?  What if we're
prefer to ask: "is the <code>Makefile</code> touched by one of the <strong>new commits</strong> (if
any) he made"?  This actually means we have to look in all the commits in
$newsha that do not already exist in the repo (i.e., reachable from $oldsha or
<em>any</em> other ref in the repo).</p>

<p>As you can see, that's quite a distinction.  Even the code isn't
straightforward:</p>

<pre><code>git rev-list $newsha --not --all | xargs -r git show --name-only $nf --format=%n | grep . | sort -u
</code></pre>

<p>[Note: There're probably a few other ways to skin that cat; I'm open to better ideas.]</p>

<p>How about another wrinkle?  What if we want to make a distinction between
adding a <strong>new file</strong> which did not exist in the branch before, and updating
one that already existed?  We have a project where a small set of 3rd party
JAR files (yes, binaries!) are needed to be regularly checked in for
completeness of the build scripts[1].  It is possible that a junior dev may
end up having to update one of these and push, and we want to allow that,
while preventing him from pushing any of the myriad other JAR files in his
work tree.</p>

<p>[1] -- please let us not discuss other ways of doing this; we're discussing
gitolite features here not git features.</p>

<p>In short, we can't just use <code>VR_NAME/.*\.jar</code> as the refex.  In fact, the
command that we want to use to check for the presence of "JAR" files is not
<code>git diff $oldsha $newsha</code> but <code>git diff --diff-filter=A $oldsha $newsha</code>.</p>

<p>As you can see, that's now <em>two</em> different wrinkles on the simple <code>VR_NAME</code>
virtual ref.</p>

<p>And it's not just the NAME virtual ref; they will apply equally well to the
<code>VR_COUNT</code> script too -- a rule like</p>

<pre><code>-   VR_COUNT/10         =   @interns
</code></pre>

<p>is meant to protect from large-scale changes (as described near the top of
this document), but it also suffers the same problems as <code>VR_NAME</code> if the poor
lowly intern should decide to create a personal branch from an existing one;
the rule doesn't satisfy the "count less than 10" and the push is denied.</p>

<p>The way to deal with this is to allow VR scripts to accept an optional list of
arguments after the first 5 (see <code>VR_COUNT</code> for more).  Let us say we decide
an argument of <code>nc</code> (new commit) describes the first situation, and <code>nf</code> (new
file) describes the second one.  To specify that you want interns not to add
<em>new</em> JAR files (but that it is OK to push changes to JAR files that already
existed), you just use <code>VR_NAME-nf/.*\.jar</code> as the refex.  Similarly, if you
want to say "he's allowed to branch off from or merge in a branch that already
has the forbidden file, but he can't make changes to the file <em>himself</em>", you
use <code>VR_NAME-nc/.*\.jar</code> as the refex.</p>

<p>[I hope I need not mention that the <em>code</em> of the VR script should process
these optional arguments and change its behaviour accordingly!]</p>

<p>So here's the simple convention: a virtual ref name in the gitolite.conf file
can contain hyphens that separate arguments.  So <code>VR_NAME-nf</code> passes <code>nf</code> as
the 6th argument (after the first 5 mandatory ones -- see <code>VR_COUNT</code> for
details) to the <code>gl-VR_NAME</code> script.  And (if you're willing to test it!)
<code>VR_COUNT-nf-nc</code> passes both <code>nf</code> and <code>nc</code> as the 6th and 7th arguments to the
count script.</p>

<p>Mnemonic: <code>VR_FOO-bar-baz</code> is like <code>VR_FOO -bar -baz</code>.</p>

<p><a name="virtualrefs_and_scoring_scoring_"></a></p>

<h2>scoring</h2>

<p>Restrictions based on virtual reftypes are totally orthogonal to and
independent from branch/tag name ("real" ref) restrictions.  To succeed, the
push has to satisfy all reftypes that apply to this user.</p>

<p>However, what if you need something like the following, where we are
specifying a condition that is spanning two reftypes:</p>

<pre><code> * alice can do anything on any branch except master
 * on master she can do anything except push file "foo"
</code></pre>

<p>This was not possible earlier, but now it can be done by the following syntax
(and it's backward compatible too, assuming no one creates branch names that
look like integers!):</p>

<pre><code>RW+     master          =   alice       # line 1
RW+ 20                  =   alice       # line 2

-       VR_NAME/foo     =   alice       # line 3
RW+     VR_NAME/        =   alice       # line 4
</code></pre>

<p>This has the following semantics:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the default "score" is 10 for a RW/RW+/etc. rule that matches the
user/repo/ref, and 0 for a "-" rule</p></li>
<li><p>for reftypes that return multiple refs, (like <code>VR_NAME/</code>, and if
someone implements it, <code>VR_TYPE</code>), the score for that reftype is the
minimum score from all the refs</p>

<ul>
<li>i.e., take the score for each ref, and use the least of them as the
score for the <code>VR_NAME/</code> reftype</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>for access to be granted, every reftype used must return a score of 10</p></li>
<li><p><em>but</em>... only the total is checked, so some rules are allowed to
<em>compensate</em> for others</p>

<ul>
<li><p>what you see above is line 2 compensating for line 3</p></li>
<li><p>when alice pushes a branch other than master (line 2), she can make
changes to file "foo" (line 3) even though line 3 returns a 0 score</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="virtualrefs_and_scoring_documentation_for_individual_virtual_refs_"></a></p>

<h2>documentation for individual virtual refs</h2>

<p>Documentation for individual virtual refs can be found in the corresponding
source file.  Documentation on how to create your own virtual refs can be
found in <code>VR_COUNT</code>.</p>

<p>The only exception is NAME, which has always been in core gitolite (and on
which the delegation feature depends), so it is documented here.</p>

<p>This section also serves as further detail on how virtual ref matching works.</p>

<p><a name="virtualrefs_and_scoring_VR_NAME__"></a></p>

<h3><code>VR_NAME</code></h3>

<p>The <code>VR_NAME</code> virtual ref returns the output of the following command:</p>

<pre><code>git diff --name-only $OLDSHA $NEWSHA
</code></pre>

<p>That is, each file/directory that was added/changed/deleted between the old
and the new SHA becomes one "ref" to be matched against any rules starting
with <code>VR_NAME/</code> in the gitolite.conf file.</p>

<p>For example, you could use this to specify that junior developers should not
be allowed to push changes to the 'Makefile':</p>

<pre><code>repo    foo
        RW+                     =   @senior_devs
        RW                      =   @junior_devs
        -   VR_NAME/Makefile    =   @junior_devs
        RW  VR_NAME/            =   @junior_devs
</code></pre>

<p>This allows senior devs to do whatever they want (notice they don't have any
<code>VR_NAME</code> reftype rules at all), while for junior devs, if they try to push a
commit series that contains a change to the 'Makefile' it will get rejected,
otherwise it gets accepted.</p>

<p>Here's another example.  Assume the project has the following contents at the
top level: a README, a "doc/" directory, and an "src/" directory.</p>

<pre><code>repo foo
        RW+                             =   lead_dev                # rule 1
        RW                              =   dev1 dev2 dev3 dev4     # rule 2

        RW  VR_NAME/doc/                =   dev1 dev2               # rule 3
        RW  VR_NAME/src/                =   dev1 dev2 dev3 dev4     # rule 4
</code></pre>

<p>Here're some points to note that might help to understand this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>virtual ref-based restrictions are <em>in addition</em> to normal (branch-name
based) restrictions; they are not a <em>replacement</em> for them.  This is why
rule #2 (or something like it, maybe with a more specific branch-name) is
needed; without it, dev1/2/3/4 cannot push any branches.</p></li>
<li><p><em>each</em> file touched by the commits being pushed is checked against those
rules.  So, <code>lead_dev</code> can push changes to any files (she has no <code>VR_NAME</code>
rules), dev1/2 can push changes to files in "doc/" and "src/" (but not the
top level README), and dev3/4 can only push changes to files in "src/".</p></li>
</ul>
