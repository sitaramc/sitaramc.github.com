<h2>lexical syntax</h2>

<p>In general, everything is <strong>space separated</strong>; there are no commas,
semicolons, etc., in the syntax.</p>

<p><strong>Comments</strong> are in the usual shell-ish style.</p>

<p><strong>User names</strong> and <strong>repo names</strong> are as simple as possible; they must start
with an alphanumeric, but after that they can also contain <code>.</code>, <code>_</code>, or <code>-</code>.</p>

<p>Usernames can optionally be followed by an <code>@</code> and a domainname containing at
least one <code>.</code> (this allows you to use an email address as someone's username).
Reponames can contain <code>/</code> characters (this allows you to put your repos in a
tree-structure for convenience)</p>

<h3>continuation lines</h3>

<p>There are no continuation lines -- gitolite does not process C-style
backslash-escaped newlines as anything special.  However, the section on
"groups" will tell you how you can break up large lists of names in a group
definition into multiple lines.</p>

<p><a name="gitolite_conf_include_files_"></a></p>

<h3>include files</h3>

<p>Gitolite allows you to break up the configuration into multiple files and
include them in the main file for convenience.</p>

<pre><code>include     "foo.conf"
</code></pre>

<p>will include the contents of the file "foo.conf".</p>

<p>Details:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You can also use a glob (<code>include "*.conf"</code>), or put your include files
into subdirectories of "conf" (<code>include "foo/bar.conf"</code>), or both
(<code>include "repos/*.conf"</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Included files are always searched from the gitolite-admin repo's "conf/"
directory, unless you supplied an absolute path.  (Note: in the interests
of cloning the admin-repo sanely you should avoid absolute paths!)</p></li>
<li><p>If you ended up recursing, files that have been already processed once are
skipped, with a warning.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><font color="gray">Advanced users: <code>subconf</code>, a command that is very closely
related to <code>include</code>, is documented <a href="deleg.html#subconf" title="the subconf command">here</a>.</font></p>
