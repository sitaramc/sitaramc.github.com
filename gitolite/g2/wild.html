<h1>repositories named with wildcards</h1>

<p><strong><em>IMPORTANT NOTE</em></strong>:</p>

<p>This feature may be somewhat "brittle" in terms of security.  Creating
repositories based on wild cards, giving "ownership" to the specific user who
created it, allowing him/her to hand out permissions to other users to
collaborate, all these are possible.  And any of these could have a bug in it.
I haven't found any yet, but that doesn't mean there aren't any.</p>

<hr />

<p>This document is mostly "by example".</p>

<h2>quick introduction</h2>

<p>The wildrepos feature allows you to specify access control rules using regular
expression patterns, so you can have many actual repos being served by a
single set of rules in the config file.  The regex pattern can also include
the word <code>CREATOR</code> in it, allowing you to parametrise the name of the user
creating the repo.  The examples below will make this clearer.</p>

<p><a name="wildcard_repositories_rc_file_setting_required_"></a></p>

<h2>rc file setting required</h2>

<p>This feature requires that you set <code>$GL_WILDREPOS</code> to "1" in <code>~/.gitolite.rc</code>
on the server.  Please search for that variable in <code>doc/gitolite.rc.mkd</code>
for more information on this.</p>

<p><a name="wildcard_repositories_examples_of_wildcard_repos_"></a></p>

<h2>examples of wildcard repos</h2>

<p>As the introduction said, you can include the word <code>CREATOR</code> in the regex
pattern, though it is not mandatory.  We'll look at examples of both types of
usage.</p>

<p>Which of these alternatives you choose depends on your needs, and the social
aspects of your environment.  Including the creator name in the pattern keeps
users rigidly separated from each others repos, and is good for a largely
autonomous collection of users with a high probability of repo name clashes.</p>

<p>Omitting the creator name from the pattern puts the repos in a common
namespace, and is suitable for environments where it is not very important to
keep track of who actually created the repo (except for granting access), but
needs more communication / co-operation among the users to avoid repo name
clashes.</p>

<p><a name="wildcard_repositories_wildcard_repos_with_creator_name_in_them_"></a></p>

<h3>wildcard repos with creator name in them</h3>

<p>Here's an example snippet:</p>

<pre><code>@prof       =   u1
@TAs        =   u2 u3
@students   =   u4 u5 u6

repo    assignments/CREATOR/a[0-9][0-9]
    C   =   @students
    RW+ =   CREATOR
    RW  =   WRITERS @TAs
    R   =   READERS @prof
</code></pre>

<p>Note the "C" permission.  This is a standalone "C", which gives the named
users the right to <em>create a repo</em>.  <font color="gray">This is not to be
confused with the "RWC" or its variants described elsewhere, which are about
<em>branches</em>, not <em>repos</em>.</font></p>

<p>For now, ignore the special usernames READERS and WRITERS, and just create a
new repo, as user "u4" (a student):</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone git@server:assignments/u4/a12
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/sitaram/t/a12/.git/
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/gitolite/repositories/assignments/u4/a12.git/
warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository.
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the <em>two</em> empty repo inits, and the order in which they occur ;-)</p>

<p><a name="wildcard_repositories_wildcard_repos_without_creator_name_in_them_"></a></p>

<h3>wildcard repos without creator name in them</h3>

<p>Here's how the same example would look if you did not want the CREATOR's name
to be part of the actual repo name.</p>

<pre><code>repo    assignments/a[0-9][0-9]
    C   =   @students
    RW+ =   CREATOR
    RW  =   WRITERS @TAs
    R   =   READERS @prof
</code></pre>

<p>We haven't changed anything except the repo name pattern.  This means that the
first student that creates, say, <code>assignments/a12</code> becomes the owner.
Mistakes (such as claiming a12 instead of a13) need to be rectified by an
admin logging on to the back end, though it's not too difficult.</p>

<p>You could also repace the C line like this:</p>

<pre><code>    C   =   @TAs
</code></pre>

<p>and have a TA create the repos in advance.</p>

<p>In either case, they could then use the <code>setperms</code> feature to specify which
users are "READERS" and which are "WRITERS".  See later for details.</p>

<h2>deleting a wild repo</h2>

<p>See <a href="wild_repodel.html" title="deleting repos safely">repo deletion</a> for more on this.  Note that this requires you
to install/setup "adc"s (admin defined commands).  See
<a href="ADCs.html" title="admin defined commands">admin-defined-commands</a> for how to do that.</p>

<hr />

<p>Enjoy, and please use with care.  This is pretty powerful stuff.  As they say:
if you break it, you get to keep both pieces :)</p>
