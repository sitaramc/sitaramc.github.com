<h1>mirroring gitolite servers</h1>

<p>Mirroring a repo is simple in git; you just need code like this in a
<code>post-receive</code> hook in each repo:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
git push --mirror slave_user@mirror.host:/path/to/repo.git
# if running gitolite, the $GL_REPO variable could be useful:
# git push --mirror slave_user@mirror.host:/repo/base/path/$GL_REPO.git
</code></pre>

<p>For a lot of people, though, mirroring is more than just 'backup', and their
needs are complex enough that setup is hard.</p>

<p><a name="mirrwhy_"></a></p>

<h2>why</h2>

<p>Gitolite's mirroring used to be very rigid -- one master, any number of
slaves, but the slaves are identical copies of the master. No variations
allowed.</p>

<p>It's now been reworked to be much more flexible, to cater to almost any kind
of setup you need. Here're some advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>faster reads for everyone</strong>: host a slave in every city you have a
sizable number of developers in, and have them access their local server
instead of hitting the WAN, at least for 'fetch' operations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>faster writes for most devs</strong>: one server doesn't have to be the master
for all repos! You can choose where a repo gets "mastered" based on where
the majority of that repo's users are.</p>

<p>This was the single biggest motivation for the re-work of gitolite's
mirroring; the rest of the cool stuff just happened as this feature took
shape.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>transparent writes</strong>: if all the mirrors are in your control (i.e., you
trust their authentication) pushes to a slave can be transparently
redirected to the master, so developers simply access their local server
for everything. They don't need to know where the master is, so they're
insulated from any changes you make behind the scenes.</p>

<p>This is as close to <strong>active-active</strong> mirroring as you can get without
worrying about race conditions and similar problems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>partial mirroring</strong>: all repos don't have to go all mirrors.  You can
choose not to mirror a repo at all, or mirror it only to certain servers.
This could be due to any reason: repo too big/high-traffic for the server,
repo has crypto code and the server is in a non-free country, repo has no
local users at that site, or (in autonomous setups) the server admin
simply doesn't want to mirror this specific repo.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>late mirroring</strong>: if you're ok with the lag, you can have some mirrors
updated only at certain times of the day, (with a simple command), instead
of every time a push happens.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>autonomous mirrors</strong>: finally, your mirrors don't have to be totally
under your control. They can be owned by someone else, and you negotiate
your mirroring with them.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, this is a bit more than a backup solution ;-)</p>

<p><a name="mirroring_RULE_NUMBER_ONE__"></a></p>

<h2>RULE NUMBER ONE!</h2>

<p><strong>RULE OF GIT MIRRORING: users should push directly to only one server</strong>!  All
the other machines (the slaves) should be updated by the master server.</p>

<p>If a user pushes directly to one of the slaves, those changes will get wiped
out on the next mirror push from the real master server.</p>

<p>Corollary: if the primary went down and you effected a changeover, you must
make sure that the primary does not come up in a push-enabled mode when it
recovers.</p>

<p><strong>Getting around rule number one</strong>: see the section on "redirecting pushes"
later.</p>

<p><a name="mirroring_concepts_and_terminology_"></a></p>

<h2>concepts and terminology</h2>

<p>Servers can host 3 kinds of repos: master, slave, and local.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A repo can be a <strong>master</strong> on one and only one server.  A repo on its
"master" server is a <strong>native</strong> repo, on slaves it is "non-native".</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>slave</strong> repo cannot be pushed to by a user.  It will only accept
pushes from a master server. (Exception: see the "redirecting pushes"
section later)</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>local</strong> repo is not involved in mirroring at all, in either direction.</p></li>
</ul>
