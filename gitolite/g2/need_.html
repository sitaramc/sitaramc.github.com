<h2>why is gitolite needed?</h2>

<p>Gitolite is separate from git, and needs to be installed and configured.  So...
why do we bother?</p>

<p>Gitolite is useful in any server that is going to host multiple git
repositories, each with many developers, where some sort of access control is
required.</p>

<p>In theory, this can be done with plain old Unix permissions: each user is a
member of one or more groups, each group "owns" one or more repositories, and
using unix permissions (especially the setgid bit -- <code>chmod g+s</code>) you can
allow/disallow users access to repos.</p>

<p>But there are several disadvantages here:</p>

<ul>
<li>every user needs a userid and password on the server.  This is usually a
killer, especially in tightly controlled environments</li>
<li>adding/removing access rights involves complex <code>usermod -G ...</code> mumblings
which most admins would rather not deal with</li>
<li><em>viewing</em> (aka auditing) the current set of permissions requires running
multiple commands to list directories and their permissions/ownerships,
users and their group memberships, and then correlating all these manually</li>
<li>auditing historical permissions or permission changes is pretty much
impossible without extraneous tools</li>
<li>errors or omissions in setting the permissions exactly can cause problems
of either kind: false accepts or false rejects</li>
<li>without going into ACLs it is not possible to give some people read-only
access while some others have read-write access to a repo (unless you make
it world-readable).  Group access just doesn't have enough granularity</li>
<li>it is absolutely impossible to restrict pushing by branch name or tag
name.</li>
</ul>

<p>Gitolite does away with all this:</p>

<ul>
<li>it uses ssh magic to remove the need to give actual unix userids to
developers</li>
<li>it uses a simple but powerful config file format to specify access rights</li>
<li>access control changes are affected by modifying this file, adding or
removing user's public keys, and "compiling" the configuration</li>
<li>this also makes auditing trivial -- all the data is in one place, and
changes to the configuration are also logged, so you can audit them.</li>
<li>finally, the config file allows distinguishing between read-only and
read-write access, not only at the repository level, but at the branch
level within repositories.</li>
</ul>
