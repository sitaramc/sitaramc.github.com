<h2>advanced access control</h2>

<p>The previous section is sufficient for most common needs, but gitolite can go
a lot further than that.</p>

<p><a name="NAME"></a></p>

<h3>restricting pushes by dir/file name using NAME/</h3>

<p>Here's a hopefully self-explanatory example.  Assume the project has the
following contents at the top level: a README, a "doc/" directory, and an
"src/" directory.</p>

<pre><code>repo foo
        RW+                             =   lead_dev                # rule 1
        RW                              =   dev1 dev2 dev3 dev4     # rule 2

        RW  NAME/                       =   lead_dev                # rule 3
        RW  NAME/doc/                   =   dev1 dev2               # rule 4
        RW  NAME/src/                   =   dev1 dev2 dev3 dev4     # rule 5
</code></pre>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the "NAME/" is part of the syntax; think of it as a keyword if you like.
The rest of it is treated as a refex to match against each file being
touched (see "SPECIFYING AND USING A REFEX" above for details)</p></li>
<li><p>file/dir NAME-based restrictions are <em>in addition</em> to normal (branch-name
based) restrictions; they are not a <em>replacement</em> for them.  This is why
rule #2 (or something like it, maybe with a more specific branch-name) is
needed; without it, dev1/2/3/4 cannot push any branches.</p></li>
<li><p>if a repo has <em>any</em> NAME/ rules, then NAME-based restrictions are checked
for <em>all</em> users.  This is why rule 3 is needed, even though we don't
actually have any NAME-based restrictions on lead_dev.  Notice the pattern
on rule 3.</p></li>
<li><p><em>each</em> file touched by the commits being pushed is checked against those
rules.  So, lead_dev can push changes to any files, dev1/2 can push
changes to files in "doc/" and "src/" (but not the top level README), and
dev3/4 can only push changes to files in "src/".</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>"deny" rules</h3>

<p><a name="gitolite_conf_warnings_and_required_reading_"></a></p>

<h4>warnings and required reading</h4>

<p>Gitolite performs access checks at 2 levels.  The first check is performed for
both read <em>and</em> write operations, while the second one happens only for write
operations.</p>

<p><strong>Required reading</strong>: <a href="tipssec_.html#2levels" title="two levels of access rights checking">this section</a> of the documentation.</p>

<p><strong>Warning</strong>: When using deny rules, the order of your rules matters, where
earlier it did not.  If you're just starting to add a deny rule to an existing
ruleset, it's a good idea to review the entire ruleset once, to make sure
you're doing it right.</p>

<p><a name="gitolite_conf_deny_rules_for_refs_in_a_repo_"></a></p>

<h4>"deny" rules for refs in a repo</h4>

<p>You can use "deny" rules for the second check, to prevent people pushing
branches or tags that they should not be allowed to.</p>

<p>Take a look at the following snippet, which <em>seems</em> to say that "bruce" can
write versioned tags (anything containing <code>refs/tags/v[0-9]</code>), but the other
staffers can't:</p>

<pre><code>    @staff = bruce whitfield martin
            [... and later ...]
    RW refs/tags/v[0-9]     = bruce
    RW refs/tags            = @staff
</code></pre>

<p>But that's not how the matching works.  As long as any refex matches the
refname being updated, it's a "yes".  Since the second refex (which says
"anything containing <code>refs/tags</code>") is a superset of the first one, it lets
anyone on <code>@staff</code> create versioned tags, not just Bruce.</p>

<p>So how do we say "these people can create any tags except tags that look like
this pattern"?</p>

<p>One way to fix this is to allow "deny" rules.  We make a small addition to the
permissions syntax, and define a more rigorous, ordered, interpretation.</p>

<p>Let's recap the <strong>existing semantics</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first matching refex that has the permission you're looking for (<code>W</code>
  or <code>+</code>), results in success.  A fallthrough results in failure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are the <strong>new semantics</strong>, with changes from the "main" one in bold:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first matching refex that has the permission you're looking for (<code>W</code>
  or <code>+</code>) <strong>or a minus (<code>-</code>)</strong>, results in success <strong>or failure,
  respectively</strong>.  A fallthrough <strong>also</strong> results in failure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the example we started with becomes, if you use "deny" rules:</p>

<pre><code>    RW refs/tags/v[0-9]     = bruce
    -  refs/tags/v[0-9]     = @staff
    RW refs/tags            = @staff
</code></pre>

<p>And here's how it works:</p>

<ul>
<li>for non-version tags, only the 3rd rule matches, so anyone on staff can
push them</li>
<li>for version tags by bruce, the first rule matches so he can push them</li>
<li>for version tags by staffers <em>other than bruce</em>, the second rule matches
before the third one, and it has a <code>-</code> as the permission, so the push
fails</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="gitolite_conf_deny_rules_for_the_entire_repo_"></a></p>

<h4>"deny" rules for the entire repo</h4>

<p>The previous section described deny rules for the second check, which is a
fairly common need.  However, gitolite does not process deny rules for the
first check -- it's usually simple enough to make sure your config file does
not allow the particular user/repo combindation at all.</p>

<p>But there's one case where this becomes cumbersome: when you want to create
exceptions to uses of <code>@all</code>.</p>

<p>For example, if you want gitweb to show <code>@all</code> repos except the special
'gitolite-admin' repo, you must manually (and laboriously) maintain a list of
all your repos (except gitolite-admin) and use that in place of <code>@all</code>.  Oh
joy...</p>

<p>But now you can do this:</p>

<pre><code>repo gitolite-admin
    -   =   gitweb daemon
    [... other access rules ...]
    config gitolite-options.deny-repo = 1

repo @all
    R   =   gitweb daemon
</code></pre>

<p>Here are some notes on how/why this works:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The order is important -- the deny rule must come first.</p></li>
<li><p>The 'config' line is what tells git to behave differently, i.e., apply
deny rules for the first check also.</p></li>
<li><p>Since there is no "ref" to match against the refexes in the rules,
gitolite just ignores the refexes, and simply looks at the permission (R,
RW, "-", etc) and the user list.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="rwcd"></a></p>

<h3>creating and deleting branches</h3>

<p>Since the beginning of gitolite, <code>RW</code> gave the ability, not only to update,
but to <em>create</em> a branch (that matched the refex).  Similarly, <code>RW+</code> meant
being able to not only rewind, but also delete a ref.  Conceptually, a rewind
is almost the same as a delete+push (the only difference I can see is if you
had core.logAllRefUpdates set, which is <em>not</em> a default setting).</p>

<p>However, there seem to be cases where it is useful to distinguish these cases.
Arguments can be made on all sides if you're dealing with new users, so
gitolite now supports that (in a backward compatible way).</p>

<p>We'll look at the delete/rewind case in detail first:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>if the rules for a repo do not contain a <code>D</code> anywhere, then <code>RW+</code> will
allow both rewind and delete operations.  Apart from being more convenient
if you don't need this separation, this also ensures backward
compatibility for setups created before this separation feature was added
to gitolite).</p></li>
<li><p>if, however, <em>any</em> of the rules for a repo contains a <code>D</code> (example: <code>RWD</code>,
<code>RW+D</code>, etc) then <code>RW+</code> by itself will permit only a rewind, not a delete</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The same thing applies to create/push, where if you have permissions like
<code>RWC</code> or <code>RW+C</code> anywhere in that repo, a simple <code>RW</code> or <code>RW+</code> can no longer
<em>create</em> a new ref.</p>

<p>You can combine the <code>C</code> and <code>D</code> also.  Thus, the set of permissions you now
know about are, in regex syntax: <code>R|RW+?C?D?</code>.  See a later section for the
full set of permissions possible.</p>

<p>Some usage hints:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>if you find that <code>RW+</code> no longer allows creation/deletion but you can't
see a <code>C</code>/<code>D</code> permission in the rules, remember that gitolite allows a
repo config to be specified in multiple places for convenience, included
delegated or included files.  Be sure to search everywhere :)</p></li>
<li><p>a quick way to make this the default for <em>all</em> your repos is:</p>

<pre><code>repo @all
    RWCD    dummy-branch    =   foo
</code></pre>

<p>where foo can be either the administrator, or if you can ignore the
warning message when you push, a non-existant user.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="mergecheck"></a></p>

<h3>enforcing a no-merges policy</h3>

<p>Some people want to enforce a no-merges policy for various reasons.  The new
"M" qualifier can be used to specify who is allowed to push merge commits.
This works just like "C" and "D" in the previous section, so <strong>please read
that for a more detailed description</strong> and apply the same ideas, (including
the <code>@all</code> trick!) to "M" for "allow merge commits".</p>

<p>The only other thing to remember is that this qualifier, if used, goes at the
end of any permission starting with <code>RW</code> (i.e., all of them except <code>R</code>).  For
example, <code>RW</code> becomes <code>RWM</code>, <code>RW+</code> becomes <code>RW+M</code>, <code>RW+CD</code> becomes <code>RW+CDM</code>.</p>
