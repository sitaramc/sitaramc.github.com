<h3>non-autonomous with local repos</h3>

<p>As above, but you want to allow each slave server to have some repos be
"local" to the server (not be mirrored), for whatever reason. Different slaves
may have different needs, so this really means that the same gitolite.conf
should behave differently on each server -- something which till now was
impossible.</p>

<p>Well what's life without a new feature once in a while? The string "HOSTNAME"
is now specially treated in an include filename. If it is seen without any
alphanumeric characters or underscores next to it on either side, it is
replaced by the value of <code>$GL_HOSTNAME</code>.</p>

<p>Setup the config as in the previous setup except that you shouldn't use repo
@all now; instead, you'll have to name the repos to be mirrored in some way.
Make sure gitolite-admin is in this list. Complete the mirror setup (including
the first-time sync command) like before.</p>

<p>Now add the line include "HOSTNAME.conf" to the end of conf/gitolite.conf, and
create new files, conf/frodo.conf, conf/sam.conf, etc., with appropriate
content.</p>

<p>That's it. When this config is pushed, each machine will have an effective
config that consists of the main file, with the correct HOSTNAME.conf included
(and all the others ignored) when the include statement is reached.</p>
