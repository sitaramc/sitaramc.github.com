<h2>basic access control</h2>

<pre><code>repo    gitolite-admin
        RW+                 =   sitaram
        # this is equivalent to:
        RW+     refs/.*     =   sitaram
</code></pre>

<p>Sitaram is the only admin.  He can push, create, delete, or rewind any branch
or tag in the gitolite-admin repo.</p>

<pre><code>repo    testing
        RW+     =   @all
</code></pre>

<p>The 'testing' repo is a play area for everyone.  Anyone can do anything to any
branch or tag on it.</p>

<pre><code>repo    foo
        RW+     =   sitaram dilbert
        RW      =   alice ashok
        R       =   wally
</code></pre>

<p>Wally can only read the repo.  Alice and Ashok can push but not rewind; only
Sitaram and Dilbert can do that.</p>

<p>And now, a common misunderstanding:</p>

<pre><code>        R master    =   wally       # WILL NOT DO WHAT YOU THINK IT DOES!!
</code></pre>

<p>This won't work.  Please see <a href="rpr_.html" title="side note: &quot;R&quot; permissions for refs">here</a> for more on this.</p>

<pre><code>repo    foo
        RW      master$             =   dilbert alice
        # this is equivalent to:
        RW      refs/heads/master$  =   dilbert alice
</code></pre>

<p>The reason for treating "master$" as "refs/heads/master$" is that  matching
branches is the most common use so the syntax is optimised to make that
simpler to write and easier to read.  Anything <em>not</em> starting with <code>refs/</code>
(<font color="gray">or <code>NAME/</code>, but that is out of scope for this
document</font>), is implicitly prefixed with <code>refs/heads/</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>master$</code> is called a "refex" (a regex that matches a ref).</p>

<p>Dilbert and Alice can push to the "master" branch.  Unless some other rule
allows it, they cannot push to, say, "master1", "masterfull" etc., due to the
<code>$</code> at the end of the refex.</p>

<p>Refexes are <em>prefix matched</em>; i.e., treated as if they have a <code>^</code> at the
start.  (This means <code>^refs/heads/master</code> in this case, not <code>^master</code>, in case
you forgot!)</p>

<p>This rule therefore does not match "headmaster", or even
"refs/heads/refs/heads/master" (<font color="gray">yes, it is possible to
confuse yourself by pushing a branch like that in git</font>).</p>

<pre><code>        RW+     pu                  =   dilbert
        # again, remember this is equivalent to:
        RW+     refs/heads/pu       =   dilbert
</code></pre>

<p>Dilbert can push any branch whose name starts with "pu".  This includes "pu1",
"pupu", "pu/up", and so on, not just "pu".  This is because there is no <code>$</code> at
the end.</p>

<pre><code>        RW      junk/               =   wally
</code></pre>

<p>Wally can push any branch under "junk/", which means "junk/foo", "junk/bar",
are ok but not "junk1" or even "junk".</p>

<pre><code>        RW      tmp/                =   @all
</code></pre>

<p>Similar to above, but for <em>any</em> authenticated user.</p>

<pre><code>        RW      refs/tags/v[0-9]    =   ashok   # the QA guy
</code></pre>

<p>Ashok is allowed to push version tags.  He can push any tag whose name starts
with a "v", then a digit, like "v1", "v1.0", "v2.0rc1", etc., but not "v-1",
"ver1".</p>
