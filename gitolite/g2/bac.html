<h2>basic access control</h2>

<p>Here's a very basic set of rules:</p>

<pre><code>repo    gitolite-admin
        RW+     =   sitaram

repo    testing
        RW+     =   @all

repo    gitolite simplicity
        RW+     =   sitaram dilbert
        RW      =   alice ashok
        R       =   wally
</code></pre>

<p>It should be easy to guess what most of this means:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>R</code> means "read" permission</li>
<li><code>RW</code> means "read and write", but no rewind</li>
<li><code>RW+</code> means "read and write", with rewind allowed</li>
</ul>

<p>A "rewind" is more often called a "non-fast forward push"; see git docs for
what that is.  The <code>+</code> was chosen because it is part of the "git push" syntax
for non-ff pushes.</p>

<p>Note that <em>tags</em> are generally considered "write once", so they are treated
specially by gitolite: you need rewind permission (<code>RW+</code>) to <em>overwrite</em> a
tag with a new value.</p>

<p>In a later section you'll see some more advanced permissions.</p>

<p><a name="gitolite_conf_how_rules_are_matched_"></a></p>

<h3>how rules are matched</h3>

<p>It's important to understand that there're two levels at which access control
happens.  Please see <a href="tipssec_.html#2levels" title="two levels of access rights checking">this</a> for details, especially about the first level
check.  Much of the complexity applies only to the second level check, so that
is all we will be discussing here.  This check is done by the update hook, and
determines whether the push succeeds or fails.</p>

<p>For basic permissions like this, matching is simple.  Gitolite already knows:</p>

<ul>
<li>the user</li>
<li>the repo</li>
<li>the branch or tag ("ref") being pushed</li>
<li>whether it is a normal (ff) push or a rewind (non-ff) push.</li>
</ul>

<p>Gitolite goes down the list of rules matching the user, repo, and the ref.
The first matching rule that has the permission you're looking for (<code>W</code> or
<code>+</code>), results in success.  A fallthrough results in failure.</p>

<p><a name="refex"></a></p>

<h3>branches, tags, and specifying "refex"es</h3>

<p>One of the original goals of gitolite was to allow access control at the
branch/tag (aka "ref") level.  The git source code contains a sample update
hook that has the following in it:</p>

<pre><code># from Documentation/howto/update-hook-example.txt:

refs/heads/master       junio
+refs/heads/pu          junio
refs/heads/cogito$      pasky
refs/heads/bw/.*        linus
refs/heads/tmp/.*       .*
refs/tags/v[0-9].*      junio
</code></pre>

<p>If you did this in gitolite, this is what the equivalents would be:</p>

<pre><code>repo    git
        RW      master$             =   junio   # line 1
        RW+     pu$                 =   junio   # line 2
        RW      cogito$             =   pasky   # line 3
        RW      bw/                 =   linus   # line 4
        RW      tmp/                =   @all    # line 5
        RW      refs/tags/v[0-9]    =   junio   # line 6
</code></pre>

<p>The following points will help you understand these rules.  (Git recap:
branches and tags together are called "ref"s in git.  A branch ref usually
looks like "refs/heads/foo", while a tag ref looks like "refs/tags/bar")</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the general syntax of a paragraph of rules is:</p>

<pre><code># start line:
repo [one or more repos and/or repo groups]
# followed by one or more permissions lines:
[permission] [zero or more refexes] = [one or more users]
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>a <strong>refex</strong> is a <em>perl regex</em> that matches a ref.  When you try to push a
commit to a branch or a tag, that "ref" is matched against the refex part
of each rule.</p></li>
<li><p>if the refex does not start with <code>refs/</code>, gitolite assumes a prefix of
<code>refs/heads/</code>.  This is useful because <em>branch</em> matching is the most
common case, as you can see this applies to lines 1 through 5 here.</p></li>
<li><p>if no refex appears, the rule applies to all refs in that repo (as if you
had specified <code>refs/.*</code> as the refex).</p></li>
<li><p>refexes are prefix-matched (they are internally anchored with <code>^</code> before
being used).  This means only the beginning of the actual ref needs to
match the refex, unless the refex has an explicit <code>$</code> meta-character at
the end (like the first 3 lines in our example do).</p>

<p>Line 5, for instance, allows anyone to push a branch inside the "tmp/"
namespace, while line 6 provides the ability to push version tags; "v1",
"v1.0", "v2.0rc1", all match the criterion specified by <code>v[0-9]</code> because
this is a prefix match only.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="groups"></a></p>

<h3>groups</h3>

<p>Gitolite allows you to define <strong>groups</strong> of repos. users, or even refexes.  A
group is semantically (but <em>not</em> syntactically) like a <code>#define</code> in C.  Here
is an example of each kind:</p>

<pre><code>@oss_repos  =   gitolite linux git perl rakudo entrans vkc
@staff      =   sitaram some_dev another-dev
@important  =   master$ QA_done refs/tags/v[0-9]
</code></pre>

<p>The syntax of a group definition is simply:</p>

<pre><code>@groupname = [one or more names]
</code></pre>

<p>A group can <em>accumulate</em> values.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>@staff      =   sitaram some_dev another-dev
@staff      =   au.thor
</code></pre>

<p>is the same as</p>

<pre><code>@staff      =   sitaram some_dev another-dev au.thor
</code></pre>

<p>This is more convenient than continuation lines, because it allows you to add
to a group anywhere.  Many people generate their gitolite.conf itself from
some <em>other</em> database, and it is very useful to be able to do this sort of
thing.</p>

<p>Groups can include other groups, and the included group will be expanded to
whatever value it <em>currently</em> has:</p>

<pre><code>@staff      =   sitaram some_dev another-dev    # line 1
@staff      =   au.thor                         # line 2
@interns    =   indy james                      # line 3
@alldevs    =   bob @interns @staff             # line 4
</code></pre>

<p>"@alldevs" expands to 7 names now.  However, remember that the config file is
parsed in a single-pass, so later <em>additions</em> to a group name cannot affect
earlier <em>uses</em> of it.  If you moved line 2 to the end, "@alldevs" would only
have 6 names in it.</p>

<p><a name="gitolite_conf_the_special_all_group_"></a></p>

<h4>the special <code>@all</code> group</h4>

<p>There's a special group called <code>@all</code> that includes all authenticated users
when used as a username; you've seen examples of it earlier.</p>

<p>Advanced users: also see the entry for <code>GL_ALL_INCLUDES_SPECIAL</code> in the
documentation for <a href="rc.html" title="configuring gitolite's advanced features -- the `.gitolite.rc` file"><code>~/.gitolite.rc</code></a>.</p>

<p>When used as a reponame, it includes all repos physically present in
<code>~/repositories</code> (or whatever is the value of <code>$REPO_BASE</code>).</p>
