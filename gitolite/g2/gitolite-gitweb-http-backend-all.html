Documentation for gitolite version 2 has been removed from the site.  I don't
mind answering the odd question from legacy users who have not yet switched
("if it ain't broke..."), but I have seen too many people reading the v2 pages
as if for the first time, or, worse, running v3 but looking at the v2 page,
etc.

<br /><br />

Gitolite v3 was released in April 2012 (i.e., as of today, about 3.5 years
ago) and it's high time you switched anyway.

<br /><br />

Here are some useful links:

<li>Gitolite main page: <a href="http://gitolite.com" class="uri">http://gitolite.com</a></li>
<li>Contact and Support: <a href="http://gitolite.com/gitolite/index.html#contact" class="uri">http://gitolite.com/gitolite/index.html#contact</a></li>

</ul>

<p>Finally, the &quot;Gitolite all-in-one page&quot; (<a href="http://gitolite.com/gitolite/gitolite.html" class="uri">http://gitolite.com/gitolite/gitolite.html</a>) is often useful when you are trying to find something across the entire set of pages. Just use your browser's Ctrl-F on this!</p>
