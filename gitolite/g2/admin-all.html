<h1>administering and running gitolite</h1>

<p><a name="admin_please_read_this_first_"></a></p>

<h2>please read this first</h2>

<p>Unless you know what you're doing, do not do <strong>anything</strong> manually on the
server (except when the documentation says you should, for example to add
custom hooks).  In particular, adding new repositories or users or changing
the access control rules should not be done directly on the server.  Things
will break.  For example, if you manually create a repo on the server, it will
not have the required "update" hook, without which there is no access control
for pushes.</p>

<p>Most normal (day-to-day) gitolite admin work is done by cloning the
gitolite-admin repo from the server to your workstation, making changes to the
clone, and pushing those changes back.</p>

<p>The installation steps in the previous section include the steps to do this
clone, so you should already have one on your workstation, in
<code>~/gitolite-admin</code>.  You can of course clone it anywhere else you want and use
that clone.</p>

<p>Either way, make sure you <code>cd</code> into this clone first.</p>

<p><em>Note</em>: some of the paths in this document use variable names.  Just refer to
<code>~/.gitolite.rc</code> for the correct values for <em>your</em> installation.</p>

<p>Once you've cloned it, you're ready to add users and repos.</p>

<h2>adding users and repos: <a href="add.html" title="adding users and repos">Link</a></h2>

<!-- file: add "adding users and repos" -->

<h2>adding users and repos</h2>

<p>Do <strong>NOT</strong> add repos or users directly on the server!  You MUST manage the
server by cloning the special 'gitolite-admin' repo on your workstation (<code>git
clone git@server:gitolite-admin</code>), making changes, and pushing them.  This
section tells you how to add users and repos.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>ask each user who will get access to send you a public key.  (Generating a
keypair is described somewhere in <a href="gl_ssh.html" title="how gitolite uses ssh">this</a> page).</p></li>
<li><p>rename each public key according to the user's name, with a <code>.pub</code>
extension, like <code>sitaram.pub</code> or <code>john-smith.pub</code>.  You can also use
periods and underscores</p></li>
<li><p>copy all these <code>*.pub</code> files to <code>keydir</code> in your gitolite-admin repo
clone.  You can also organise them into various subdirectories of <code>keydir</code>
if you wish, since the entire tree is searched.</p></li>
<li><p>edit the config file (<code>conf/gitolite.conf</code> in your admin repo clone).  See
the <a href="conf.html" title="the access control file `gitolite.conf`">gitolite.conf</a> documentation for details on what goes in that
file, syntax, etc.  Just add new repos as needed, and add new users and
give them permissions as required.  The users names should be exactly the
same as their keyfile names, but without the <code>.pub</code> extension</p></li>
<li><p>when done, commit your changes and push.  Any new repos you specified will
automatically be created (empty, but clonable) and users' access will be
updated as needed.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>using hooks</h2>

<p><a name="customhooks"></a></p>

<h3>custom hooks</h3>

<p>You can supply your own, custom, hook scripts if you wish.  Install gitolite
as usual, then:</p>

<ul>
<li>go to ~/.gitolite/hooks/common on the server and put your new hook there</li>
<li>now run "gl-setup" again</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use this procedure to install new hooks as well as to update hooks
that you had previously installed.</p>

<p><font color="red"><strong>IMPORTANT WARNINGS</strong></font></p>

<ul>
<li><p>The <code>update</code> hook in <code>hooks/common</code> is what implements all the
branch-level permissions in gitolite.  If you fiddle with the hooks
directory, please make sure you do not mess with this file accidentally,
or all your fancy per-branch permissions will stop working.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not under any conditions put anything in <code>hooks/gitolite-admin</code> --
nothing in gitolite requires you to do anything here.  Leave it alone!</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="hookchaining"></a></p>

<h3>hook chaining</h3>

<p>Sometimes you need to use git hooks for your own purposes (site-local
validations, CI integration, email notifications, or the ever popular "live
website update"!).  However, the hooks you want to use may already be in use
by gitolite.</p>

<p>This section will tell you what to do in such cases.  First, let's list the
hooks that gitolite uses:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The <code>update</code> hook is used in all repos and is critical to gitolite's
access control!</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>post-receive</code> hook is used in all repos but only if mirroring has
been enabled.  Shipped as <code>post-receive.mirrorpush</code>, it is renamed to
'post-receive' and installed as part of the mirroring setup.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>post-update</code> hook is used in the <code>gitolite-admin</code> repo only, to
"compile" the configuration and so on.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>To run your own 'update' hook, just put it in a file called <code>update.secondary</code>
and install it as a hook.  Gitolite's update hook will automatically chain to
it, taking care to pass it the same 3 arguments the original update hook
received from git.</p>

<p><font color="gray"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also see the document on <a href="vref.html" title="virtual refs">virtual refs</a> for a way to add additional
  checks that you might need.</p>
</blockquote>

<p></font></p>

<p>For <code>post-receive</code>, (if using mirroring) do the opposite.  You're normally
expected to rename the shipped 'post-receive.mirrorpush' to 'post-receive',
but don't do this.  Instead, simply run <code>hooks/post-receive.mirrorpush</code> at the
end of <em>your</em> hook code.  Do not worry about replicating STDIN (the documented
way in which a post-receive hook receives its input) because the mirroring
code does not use it.</p>

<p>To run your own <code>post-update</code> hook on normal repos, just install a hook called
'post-update' the usual way.  It'll be installed on all normal repos but not
on the special gitolite-admin repo.  If you need that for the gitolite-admin
repo, you'll have to call it <code>post-update.secondary</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, these names ('update.secondary' and 'post-update.secondary') are
merely the defaults.  You can change them to anything you want; look in
conf/example.gitolite.rc for details.</p>

<p><a name="admin_environment_variables_available_to_hooks_"></a></p>

<h3>environment variables available to hooks</h3>

<p>The following environment variables are set, and may be useful for any custom
processing you wish to do in your hook code:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>GL_USER</code> -- the user doing the push</li>
<li><code>GL_REPO</code> -- the reponame</li>
<li><code>GL_REPO_BASE_ABS</code> -- the absolute base path where all the repos are kept</li>
</ul>

<p>The following variables are also set, but are generally less useful:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>GL_BINDIR</code> -- where all the binaries live</li>
<li><code>GL_ADMINDIR</code> -- common directory for many gitolite things</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="admin_gl_post_init_hook_"></a></p>

<h3>"gl-post-init" hook</h3>

<p>Sometimes it is necessary to do something whenever a new repo is created.  If
you need this functionality, just supply a hook called "gl-post-init" with
whatever code you want in it.</p>

<p><a name="pre-git"></a></p>

<h3>"gl-pre-git" hook</h3>

<p>Although git has lots of nice hooks you can tap into, they all run only on a
push.  There's nothing that runs on a fetch or a clone, and there's no way to
run something <em>before</em> git-receive-pack or git-upload-pack, (as the case may
be) are invoked.</p>

<p>That's what the <code>gl-pre-git</code> hook is for.  If an executable hook called
<code>gl-pre-git</code> is present, it will be invoked with the current directory set to
<code>repo.git</code>, and with a single argument which will be either <code>R</code> or <code>W</code>
depending on what the client is trying to do.  The environment variables
<code>GL_USER</code> and <code>GL_REPO</code> are available.  STDOUT will be forced to STDERR before
it is called, to avoid confusing the client.</p>

<p>If the code returns anything other than 0, gitolite will terminate the
operation (i.e., not run git at all), just like many git hooks do, so make
sure you end with <code>exit 0</code> or equivalent.</p>

<!-- file: moverepos "moving pre-existing repos into gitolite" -->

<h3>moving pre-existing repos into gitolite</h3>

<p>It's best to split this into different use cases.</p>

<p><strong>Case 1 -- few repos</strong>: This is for moving one or two repos at a time, when
you have a copy of the repo on your workstation.  It is also the <em>only</em> way if
you have push rights to the admin repo but no <em>shell</em> privileges on the
server.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>let gitolite create it as a brand new repo as described in the section on
"adding users and repos" at the top</p></li>
<li><p>cd to the clone on your workstation.  Make sure all the branches are
correct and no extra stuff, "temp" branches, etc., are present</p></li>
<li><p>now run these two commands</p>

<pre><code>git push --all git@server:reponame
git push --tags git@server:reponame
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>(You could also use "git push --mirror" instead of separately doing
branches and tags, but that will carry across <em>your</em> remote refs also, and
typically you may not want that.  Anyway please do a <code>git ls-remote
git@server:repo</code> to make sure all the stuff you want went through, and is
named correctly).</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Case 2 -- many repos</strong>: This is when you have many existing repos to add,
and they're all bare (as good little server repos should be) and you have
shell access on the server.  Here's how to do it; please note the order is
important here:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>make doubly sure they're <em>bare</em> repos ;-)</p></li>
<li><p>log on to the server and copy the repos to <code>$REPO_BASE</code> (which defaults to
<code>~/repositories</code>), making sure that the directory names end in ".git".</p></li>
<li><p>back on your workstation, add each repo (without the <code>.git</code> suffix) to
<code>conf/gitolite.conf</code> in your gitolite-admin repo clone.  Give <em>some</em> user
(even a non-existent one like "DUMMY" is fine) at least "R" access to
these repos.  Then add, commit, push.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Case 3 -- far too many repos</strong> (or your initials are JH ;-): This is when
you're like Case 2, except you have <em>so many</em> repos that step 3 becomes too
cumbersome (even with a script doing it for you).</p>

<p>Assuming you can group your repo names into various patterns, and can use
similar access control lines within each such group, you can use gitolite's
"wildcard repos" feature.</p>

<p>First read the <a href="wild.html" title="repositories named with wildcards">wildcard repositories</a> document, or at least skim
through it, to understand the basic concept.  Then do this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>do step 1 just like step 1 in Case 2 above</p></li>
<li><p>ditto for step 2</p></li>
<li><p>for each repo, determine who the owner should be and create files called
<code>gl-creater</code> (note spelling!) in each repo.  The file should contain
exactly one line with the owner name.</p></li>
<li><p>run <code>gl-setup</code> again (you don't need to supply a pub key filename)</p></li>
<li><p>finally add the repos to the conf, maybe something like this, (in this
example, the owner name was the second component of the repo path), and
add/commit/push:</p>

<pre><code>repo    pub/CREATOR/..*
        C   =   @developers
        RW+ =   CREATOR
        RW  =   WRITERS
        R   =   READERS
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Details</strong></p>

<p><font color="gray"></p>

<ul>
<li><p>why is the order of steps different in case 1 and case 2?</p>

<p>Because in case 2, the actual data is coming from an OS 'cp' (copy)
command, not via a normal push like in case 1.  Since that happens outside
gitolite, it's easier to do it first, then tell gitolite about the repo so
it can add hooks.  (If you tell gitolite first, it will create an empty
repo as soon as you push, then your 'cp' will have to overwrite those
files, but you'll then lose gitolite's hooks, etc.  A bit more messy).</p></li>
<li><p>what's with the <code>gl-creater</code> file in case 3?</p>

<p>What the <a href="wild.html" title="repositories named with wildcards">wildcard repositories</a> document does not explain is how
ownership is <em>recorded</em> in gitolite: the <code>gl-creater</code> file contains the
owner name.  If you want to "pretend" these repos were created by some
user, you need to add that in.  That user then gets whatever access you
gave to "CREATOR" in the access rules (in our example, that was <code>RW+</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>why does case 3 need the <code>gl-setup</code> command?</p>

<p>An admin push only checks hooks on normal (non-wildcard) repos.  It would
be too timetaking otherwise.  Running <code>gl-setup</code> forces it to do this more
aggressively than an admin push, looking at wildcard repos as well as
normal ones.</p></li>
</ul>

<p></font></p>

<p>In the end, it all boils down to (a) making sure the <code>update</code> hook is correct
on all repos, wild or normal, and (b) making sure <code>gl-creater</code> contains the
owner name for wild repos.  The rest of the setup is in the conf file.</p>

<h3>moving the whole thing from one server to another</h3>

<p>[<strong>NOTE</strong>: I would appreciate help testing these instructions]</p>

<p>Here's the simplest set of instructions, assuming the destination is a recent
gitolite (has the 'gl-admin-push' command).  Unless specified, all steps are
on the <em>new</em> server.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>install</strong> gitolite.  Don't worry about the pubkey used in the gl-setup
step -- for example this will do fine:</p>

<pre><code>ssh-keygen -q -N '' -f dummy
gl-setup -q dummy.pub
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><strong>edit</strong> the rc file to have similar settings to the old one.</p>

<p>Do not copy the entire file outright -- some of the variables (notably
<code>GL_PACKAGE_CONF</code> and <code>GL_PACKAGE_HOOKS</code>) are installation dependent and
should not be touched!  Do a diff or a vimdiff and copy across only what
you know <em>you</em> changed on the old server.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>disable</strong> the old server so your users will not push any changes to it.
There are several ways to do this, but the simplest is to insert this line
at the top of <code>~/.gitolite.rc</code> on the old server:</p>

<pre><code>exit 1;
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><strong>copy</strong> the contents of <code>$REPO_BASE</code> in the old server to <code>$REPO_BASE</code> on
the new server.  By default, as you know, these are both
<code>$HOME/repositories</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><code>chown -R</code></strong> the files to the correct user if you copied using root.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>fix up</strong> the hooks</p>

<pre><code>gl-setup
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><strong>trigger</strong> a push to the admin repo</p>

<pre><code>git clone repositories/gitolite-admin.git /tmp/gitolite-admin
cd /tmp/gitolite-admin
git commit --allow-empty -m 'trigger compile on new server'
gl-admin-push -f
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>Done.</p>

<!-- file: admin "custom git config" -->

<p><a name="admin_custom_git_config_"></a></p>

<h3>custom git config</h3>

<p>The custom hooks feature is a blunt instrument -- all repos get the hook you
specified and will run it.  You can of course install hooks manually on the
server, but sometimes that's cumbersome.</p>

<p>Instead, you could set your hooks to only work if a certain "gitconfig"
variable was set.  See <a href="confother_.html#rsgc" title="repo specific `git config` commands">this</a> for a way to specify "git config"
settings on a per repository basis.</p>
