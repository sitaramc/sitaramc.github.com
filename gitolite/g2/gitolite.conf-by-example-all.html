<h1>gitolite.conf -- by example</h1>

<p>I hate people who make statements like "I dont have time to learn".  People
with that sort of attitude shouldn't use gitolite at all, and I refuse to
spoon-feed them or be their personal tutor.</p>

<p>However, it's possible that even with the right attitude and willingness to
learn, some people just get a mental block about something, and so I figure
this might help.</p>

<p>(Side note: followup questions not welcome from people in the former category;
you know who you are).</p>

<p><strong>WARNING 1</strong>: in case of conflict between this document and reality, reality
wins.  For conflict between this document and the <a href="conf.html" title="the access control file `gitolite.conf`">main document</a>, the
main document wins.  In any case, please bring such issues to my notice.</p>

<p><strong>WARNING 2</strong>: this document has examples only for the most commonly used
features.  If you don't find a feature here, look in the main document before
asking me.</p>

<p><strong>WARNING 3</strong>: Read the WHOLE document.  I can't keep saying, for instance,
that "rewind" actually means any of 3 different things so I'll say it only
once.  It's upto you to have read that part also.</p>

<h2>general notes</h2>

<p>Git branch/tag name <strong>recap</strong>: branches look like refs/heads/something, tags
look like refs/tags/something.  When there is no ambiguity, we leave out the
refs/heads/ and the refs/tags/.</p>

<p>A "rewind" means any of 3 things: force-push a branch (make it go backward,
using 'git push -f' or equivalent), delete a branch, or update a tag.  The
first two are clearly information-losing operations so it is wise to require
special rights to do them.  The third is in the same category because tags are
supposed to be "write once" so <strong>re</strong>-writing a tag is considered abnormal.</p>

<p>These examples are only for the more complex parts of the conf file.  We're
not going to discuss things like what characters are allowed in a username or
reponame, how to write a comment line, how to write continuation lines (you
can't), include files, and all such <em>lexical</em> issues.</p>

<h2>extremely brief regex overview: <a href="regexov.html" title="extremely brief regex overview">Link</a></h2>

<!-- file: regexov "extremely brief regex overview" -->

<h2>extremely brief regex overview</h2>

<p>Regexes are powerful.  Gitolite uses that power as much as it can.  If you
can't handle that power, hire someone who can and become a manager.</p>

<p>That said, here's a very quick overview of the highlights.</p>

<p><code>^</code> and <code>$</code> are called "anchors".  They anchor the match to the beginning and
end of the string respectively.</p>

<pre><code>^foo    matches any string starting with 'foo'
foo$    matches any string ending with 'foo'
^foo$   matches exact string 'foo'.
</code></pre>

<p>To be precise, the last one is "any string starting and ending with <em>the same</em>
'foo'".  "foofoo" does not match.</p>

<p><code>[0-9]</code> is an example of a character class; it matches any single digit.
<code>[a-z]</code> matches any lower case alpha, and <code>[0-9a-f]</code> is the range of hex
characters.  You should now guess what <code>[a-zA-Z0-9_]</code> does.</p>

<p><code>.</code> (the period) is special -- it matches any character.  If you want to match
an actual period, you need to say <code>\.</code>.</p>

<p><code>*</code>, <code>?</code>, and <code>+</code> are quantifiers.  They apply to the previous token.  <code>a*</code>
means "zero or more 'a' characters".  Similarly <code>a+</code> means "one or more", and
<code>a?</code> means "zero or one".</p>

<p>As a result, <code>.*</code> means "any number (including zero) of any character".</p>

<p>The previous token need not be a single character; you can use parens to make
it longer.  <code>(foo)+</code> matches one or more "foo", (like "foo", "foofoo",
"foofoofoo", etc.)</p>

<h2>basic access control</h2>

<pre><code>repo    gitolite-admin
        RW+                 =   sitaram
        # this is equivalent to:
        RW+     refs/.*     =   sitaram
</code></pre>

<p>Sitaram is the only admin.  He can push, create, delete, or rewind any branch
or tag in the gitolite-admin repo.</p>

<pre><code>repo    testing
        RW+     =   @all
</code></pre>

<p>The 'testing' repo is a play area for everyone.  Anyone can do anything to any
branch or tag on it.</p>

<pre><code>repo    foo
        RW+     =   sitaram dilbert
        RW      =   alice ashok
        R       =   wally
</code></pre>

<p>Wally can only read the repo.  Alice and Ashok can push but not rewind; only
Sitaram and Dilbert can do that.</p>

<p>And now, a common misunderstanding:</p>

<pre><code>        R master    =   wally       # WILL NOT DO WHAT YOU THINK IT DOES!!
</code></pre>

<p>This won't work.  Please see <a href="rpr_.html" title="side note: &quot;R&quot; permissions for refs">here</a> for more on this.</p>

<pre><code>repo    foo
        RW      master$             =   dilbert alice
        # this is equivalent to:
        RW      refs/heads/master$  =   dilbert alice
</code></pre>

<p>The reason for treating "master$" as "refs/heads/master$" is that  matching
branches is the most common use so the syntax is optimised to make that
simpler to write and easier to read.  Anything <em>not</em> starting with <code>refs/</code>
(<font color="gray">or <code>NAME/</code>, but that is out of scope for this
document</font>), is implicitly prefixed with <code>refs/heads/</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>master$</code> is called a "refex" (a regex that matches a ref).</p>

<p>Dilbert and Alice can push to the "master" branch.  Unless some other rule
allows it, they cannot push to, say, "master1", "masterfull" etc., due to the
<code>$</code> at the end of the refex.</p>

<p>Refexes are <em>prefix matched</em>; i.e., treated as if they have a <code>^</code> at the
start.  (This means <code>^refs/heads/master</code> in this case, not <code>^master</code>, in case
you forgot!)</p>

<p>This rule therefore does not match "headmaster", or even
"refs/heads/refs/heads/master" (<font color="gray">yes, it is possible to
confuse yourself by pushing a branch like that in git</font>).</p>

<pre><code>        RW+     pu                  =   dilbert
        # again, remember this is equivalent to:
        RW+     refs/heads/pu       =   dilbert
</code></pre>

<p>Dilbert can push any branch whose name starts with "pu".  This includes "pu1",
"pupu", "pu/up", and so on, not just "pu".  This is because there is no <code>$</code> at
the end.</p>

<pre><code>        RW      junk/               =   wally
</code></pre>

<p>Wally can push any branch under "junk/", which means "junk/foo", "junk/bar",
are ok but not "junk1" or even "junk".</p>

<pre><code>        RW      tmp/                =   @all
</code></pre>

<p>Similar to above, but for <em>any</em> authenticated user.</p>

<pre><code>        RW      refs/tags/v[0-9]    =   ashok   # the QA guy
</code></pre>

<p>Ashok is allowed to push version tags.  He can push any tag whose name starts
with a "v", then a digit, like "v1", "v1.0", "v2.0rc1", etc., but not "v-1",
"ver1".</p>

<h3>"deny" rules</h3>

<p><strong>Warning</strong>: When using deny rules, the order of your rules matters, where
earlier it did not.</p>

<p>PROCESSING LOGIC:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first matching refex that has the permission you're looking for (<code>W</code>
  or <code>+</code>) <strong>or a minus (<code>-</code>)</strong>, results in success <strong>or failure,
  respectively</strong>.  A fallthrough <strong>also</strong> results in failure.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>    RW refs/tags/v[0-9]     = ashok
    -  refs/tags/v[0-9]     = @staff
    RW refs/tags            = @staff
</code></pre>

<p>This allows only Ashok to write "version tags" (see rule for Ashok the QA guy
somewhere above).  The others can write any tags they want, <em>except</em> version
tags.  To understand this, try and match each rule <em>in sequence</em> with the name
of the tag being pushed, and the user doing it, applying the logic described
earlier.</p>

<ul>
<li>for non-version tags, only the 3rd rule matches, so anyone on staff can
push them</li>
<li>for version tags by ashok, the first rule matches so he can push them</li>
<li>for version tags by staffers <em>other than ashok</em>, the second rule matches
before the third one, and it has a <code>-</code> as the permission, so the push
fails</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="ruleaccum2"></a></p>

<h3>rule accumulation</h3>

<p>Rules accumulate.  Even when separated by rules for other repos.  They
accumulate intuitively.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>repo foo
    RW+             =   alice

repo bar
    RW+             =   dilbert

repo @all
    RW  dev/USER/   =   @staff

repo foo
    RW+ tmp/        =   @staff
</code></pre>

<p>has the <strong>effective</strong> ruleset, for repo foo, of</p>

<pre><code>repo foo
    RW+             =   alice
    RW  dev/USER/   =   @staff
    RW+ tmp/        =   @staff
</code></pre>

<p>Just remember that if you use <a href="aac.html#deny" title="&quot;deny&quot; rules">deny rules</a> anywhere then the <em>order of the
rules matters</em>!</p>

<p><a name="gitolite_conf_by_example_gitweb_and_daemon_"></a></p>

<h3>gitweb and daemon</h3>

<p>Gitolite does NOT do anything for gitweb and daemon access <strong>except</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>for daemon, create the file <code>git-daemon-export-ok</code> in the repository</li>
<li>for gitweb, add the repo (plus owner name, if given) to the list of
projects to be served by gitweb (see the config file variable
<code>$PROJECTS_LIST</code>, which should have the same value you specified for
<code>$projects_list</code> when setting up gitweb)</li>
<li>put the description, if given, in <code>$repo/description</code></li>
</ul>
