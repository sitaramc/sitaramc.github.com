<h1>gitolite installation</h1>

<p>(Note: git servers are most commonly used with ssh URLs, and this document
describes installing gitolite to support such usage.  If your users prefer
http URLs, read <a href="http.html" title="how to setup gitolite to use smart http mode">this</a> to install gitolite to support "smart http").</p>

<h2>installing and upgrading gitolite</h2>

<p>This section tells you how to install/upgrade gitolite, without too much
background.  Later sections have more details and troubleshooting info; please
read them before asking for help if you have problems.</p>

<p>A bare minimum gitolite setup has:</p>

<ul>
<li>a server</li>
<li>a "hosting user" on the server (a real Unix userid; we use "git" in this
document, although RPM/DEB installs use "gitolite")</li>
<li>a virtual "admin user" -- the user who sets up gitolite and configures it</li>
<li>the admin user's client or workstation, from which he does all his work</li>
</ul>

<p>Gitolite allows 3 methods of install.  The two most common are (1) the
<strong>package method</strong>, used if you have a gitolite RPM or a DEB available, and
(2) the <strong>non-root method</strong> which is the preferred manual install mode.  Less
commonly used is (3) the <strong>root method</strong>, which is useful if you plan to have
multiple "hosting users" on the same server.</p>

<p>These install methods are described in detail below.  (<em>Once you finish the
install, read the <a href="admin.html" title="administering and running gitolite">admin document</a> to administer your gitolite
installation</em>).</p>

<h3>root method: <a href="root.html" title="root method">Link</a></h3>


<p><a name="upgrade"></a></p>

<h3>upgrading</h3>

<p>Upgrading is easy; you just re-run some of the same commands used for install.
These commands are clearly noted in the install instructions above.</p>

<p>However, if you've added any new hooks, you must also run the next step (the
<code>gl-setup</code> command), although this time you don't need to supply a pubkey
filename as an argument.</p>

<h2>install trouble?</h2>

<p>If you run into trouble, please read the following sections.</p>

<p><a name="install_common_install_problems_"></a></p>

<h3>common install problems</h3>

<p>The most common problem is usually ssh.  Here are three facts of ssh:</p>

<ul>
<li>ssh is a pain</li>
<li>most people don't know ssh well enough</li>
<li>even people who think they do, don't</li>
</ul>

<p>Please read how <a href="gl_ssh.html" title="how gitolite uses ssh">gitolite uses ssh</a> and the <a href="sts.html" title="ssh troubleshooting">ssh
troubleshooting</a> documents before asking for help.</p>

<p>If you've tried multiple methods of install, you may have multiple copies of
the sources lying around.  This could be a problem; see <a href="install.html#instpath" title="appendix a: PATH issues for gl-setup">appendix a</a>
for how to detect and deal with this.</p>

<p>If none of this works read the rest of this document, understand it as much as
you can, then ask for help.</p>

<p><a name="instnameconv"></a></p>

<h3>naming conventions used</h3>

<p>Throughout the documentation, we use "YourName" as the admin user, and his
workstation is called "client".  The hosting user is "git", and the server is
called "server".  <strong>Please substitute your values as needed</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>If you're using DEB or RPM</strong>, the installer creates a user called
"gitolite", so substitute that for "git" anywhere in the docs where the
"hosting user" is mentioned as "git".</p>

<p>Also, we often say "the rc file".  This means <code>~/.gitolite.rc</code> on the server.
And when we say the "access control rules", or "conf file", or "config file",
we mean <code>conf/gitolite.conf</code> on your gitolite-admin clone.</p>

<h2>appendixes</h2>

<p>The following sections have some miscellaneous information that does not
cleanly to fit anywhere else.</p>

<p><a name="instpath"></a></p>

<h3>appendix a: PATH issues for gl-setup</h3>

<p>If you've tried multiple methods of install, you may have multiple copies of
the sources lying around, and when you ran <code>gl-setup</code> it picked up the wrong
one.  This might also happen if the directory you supplied as the first
argument to <code>gitolite/src/gl-system-install</code> is not even in the <code>$PATH</code>.</p>

<p>Run <code>su - git</code> then <code>which gl-setup</code> to see which it picked up.  This is what
it should be for each method:</p>

<ul>
<li>RPM/DEB method: probably <code>/usr/bin</code></li>
<li>root method: the first argument to the <code>gitolite/src/gl-system-install</code> command (or
<code>/usr/local/bin</code> by default)</li>
<li>non-root method: the first argument to the <code>gitolite/src/gl-system-install</code> command
(or <code>$HOME/bin</code> by default)</li>
</ul>

<p>If this is not what you get, remove the partially installed or extraneous
sources, if any, and try again.  Or fix your <code>$PATH</code>.</p>

<p>One situation that is not easy to solve is if the system admin installed
gitolite using the RPM/DEB or root methods, and you want to install a later
version using the non-root method.  Since <code>/usr/bin</code> and <code>/usr/local/bin</code> are
usually earlier than <code>$HOME/bin</code> in the <code>$PATH</code>, you'll have to get creative.
Good luck.</p>

<h3>appendix b: cleaning out a botched install</h3>

<p>When people have trouble installing gitolite, they often try to change a bunch
of things manually on the server.  Or sometimes they'll upgrade from one
install method to another without checking some things over properly.  Or
they'll follow instructions meant for a much newer version of gitolite and
make a royal mess of the whole thing.</p>

<p>Here's how to clean up, without losing your actual repositories.</p>

<p>All this is on the server.  Note that the instructions are so long because
they're generic enough to fit any situation.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Clean out the existing install</p>

<ul>
<li><p>edit <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> and delete all lines between <code># gitolite
start</code> and <code># gitolite end</code> inclusive.</p></li>
<li><p>look in <code>~/.gitolite.rc</code> for 2 variables starting with <code>GL_PACKAGE_</code>.
If they are defined (and not just commented out), you need to clean
out all gitolite related files and directories from those two paths.</p>

<p>Just for reference, the defaults for a non-root install are 'conf' and
'hooks' in <code>$HOME/share/gitolite</code>, while for an RPM/DEB or root
install they should be in <code>/var/gitolite/</code> or some such.</p>

<p>If those variables don't exist or are commented out, ignore this step.</p></li>
<li><p>look in <code>$PATH</code> for any gitolite programs and delete them also.  A
good way to hunt them down is <code>which gl-auth-command</code>, and in the path
you find, delete all "gl-*" programs (perhaps after checking the list,
if the path you find happens to be /usr/bin or such!!)</p>

<p>Repeat this step until there are no more.  I know of people who mixed
different install methods and had two, or even three, versions lying
around.</p></li>
<li><p>make some temp directory (say "old"), and <strong>move</strong> the following
files/directories into it: <code>~/.gitolite</code>, <code>~/.gitolite.rc</code> and
<code>~/repositories/gitolite-admin.git</code>.  If there's nothing you need to
salvage from them you can delete them too.</p></li>
<li><p>if you used an RPM/DEB install, remove the package also.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Now install a fresh copy of gitolite using whatever method you prefer.
(If you used a different method earlier and did not clean things out
properly per the instructions given above, expect trouble).</p></li>
<li><p>You now have a brand new "rc" file.  If your old rc file had any
non-default settings you should <strong>manually</strong> pull them in to the new one.
However, <strong>do NOT</strong> change the two variables starting with <code>GL_PACKAGE_</code>
in the new rc file; even if the old one had something different leave them
alone.</p></li>
<li><p>You also have a brand new gitolite-admin repo.  Clone this to your
workstation, then use the saved copy of the old admin repo to salvage
whatever you need (entire revision history, or just the conf/key files,
whatever floats your boat).</p>

<p>Once you've got your admin repo looking how you want it, including 'repo'
statements for all your existing repos, just add/commit/push it.</p></li>
<li><p>Go back to the server and run <code>gl-setup</code> once again (no arguments needed).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That should do it.</p>

<h3>appendix c: uninstalling gitolite completely</h3>

<p>To uninstall gitolite completely, first follow the "clean out..." steps in the
previous section.</p>

<p>If you have not really started using gitolite properly yet, you can remove all
of <code>~/repositories</code> also and be done.</p>

<p>But if you <em>do</em> need to preserve the other repos and wish to continue to use
them, remove all the <code>update</code> hooks that gitolite installs in each repository.
The easiest way is:</p>

<pre><code>find ~/repositories -wholename "*.git/hooks/update" | xargs rm -f
</code></pre>

<p>but you can do it manually if you want to be careful.</p>

<p><a name="gl-setup"></a></p>

<h3>appendix d: command line options for gl-setup</h3>

<p>After gl-system-install (or the RPM/DEB) have installed the <em>code</em>, gl-setup
sets up the actual gitolite instance.  (Gitolite in <a href="pictures.html" title="gitolite in pictures">pictures</a> may help
explain this better.)</p>

<p>In ssh mode, gl-setup expects a pubkey filename the first time it is run, and
will complain if you don't supply it.  On subsequent runs it is optional; you
only need to supply it if you want to quickly and easily change the admin's
(or indeed anyone's!) pubkey without going through all the steps that
<a href="adminpush.html" title="gl-admin-push: bypassing gitolite for the gitolite-admin repo">gl-admin-push</a> requires.</p>

<p>In http mode, gl-setup expects an "admin name" the first time it is run.  On
subsequent runs, arguments are ignored.</p>

<p>gl-setup accepts the following command line options, which must appear
<em>before</em> the pubkey filename/admin name:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>-q</code> -- quiet mode; suppress the editor that pops up to allow you to
change the rc file the first time.  Meaningless/ignored on subseqent runs.</li>
<li><code>-q -q</code> -- extra quiet mode; suppress the editor as well as the
sshkeys-lint check at the end of the run.  Old-timers who know ssh so well
that they still use protocol 1 keys <em>must</em> use this mode, because
sshkeys-lint will barf on them.  Equivalent to <code>-q</code> in http mode.</li>
</ul>
