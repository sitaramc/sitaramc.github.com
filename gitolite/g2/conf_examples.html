<h1>gitolite.conf -- by example</h1>

<p>I hate people who make statements like "I dont have time to learn".  People
with that sort of attitude shouldn't use gitolite at all, and I refuse to
spoon-feed them or be their personal tutor.</p>

<p>However, it's possible that even with the right attitude and willingness to
learn, some people just get a mental block about something, and so I figure
this might help.</p>

<p>(Side note: followup questions not welcome from people in the former category;
you know who you are).</p>

<p><strong>WARNING 1</strong>: in case of conflict between this document and reality, reality
wins.  For conflict between this document and the <a href="conf.html" title="the access control file `gitolite.conf`">main document</a>, the
main document wins.  In any case, please bring such issues to my notice.</p>

<p><strong>WARNING 2</strong>: this document has examples only for the most commonly used
features.  If you don't find a feature here, look in the main document before
asking me.</p>

<p><strong>WARNING 3</strong>: Read the WHOLE document.  I can't keep saying, for instance,
that "rewind" actually means any of 3 different things so I'll say it only
once.  It's upto you to have read that part also.</p>

<h2>general notes</h2>

<p>Git branch/tag name <strong>recap</strong>: branches look like refs/heads/something, tags
look like refs/tags/something.  When there is no ambiguity, we leave out the
refs/heads/ and the refs/tags/.</p>

<p>A "rewind" means any of 3 things: force-push a branch (make it go backward,
using 'git push -f' or equivalent), delete a branch, or update a tag.  The
first two are clearly information-losing operations so it is wise to require
special rights to do them.  The third is in the same category because tags are
supposed to be "write once" so <strong>re</strong>-writing a tag is considered abnormal.</p>

<p>These examples are only for the more complex parts of the conf file.  We're
not going to discuss things like what characters are allowed in a username or
reponame, how to write a comment line, how to write continuation lines (you
can't), include files, and all such <em>lexical</em> issues.</p>
