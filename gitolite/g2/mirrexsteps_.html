<h2>step by step</h2>

<p>If the script is not cutting it for you and want to vary the technique for
some reason, or you simply want to gain a better understanding of what is
happening, it may be better to do each step manually instead of just using the
script.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: all files mentioned below are assumed to be under <strong><code>conf/</code></strong>.  The
only place where you have to explicitly state this is in the delegation code
in the appendix.  The rest of the time, "conf/" is assumed.</p>

<p><a name="mirroring_complex_example_1_gitolite_conf__"></a></p>

<h3>(1) <code>gitolite.conf</code></h3>

<p>The main config file has these items in it.  <strong>Please add them in this
order</strong>.</p>

<p>If you follow this document completely, your gitolite.conf file can be pretty
static, changing only if the master admin changes or you need to add a new
host as slave to the gitolite-admin repo.  Therefore you can set it up first.</p>

<p>Here's what it looks like:</p>

<pre><code># (1.1)---------------------------------------------------------------------
# First the main setup:

@master-admins    =   sitaram dilbert
repo gitolite-admin
    RW+ =   @master-admins
    config gitolite.mirror.master   =   "master"
    config gitolite.mirror.slaves   =   "list of slave servers"
    # you cannot use continuation lines for this; sorry!  You have to list
    # them all in ONE long line within one set of double quotes...

# (1.2)---------------------------------------------------------------------
# If you have any files with "convenience" group definitions, pull them in:

include "groups/users.conf"
include "groups/repos.conf"

# (1.3)---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Next is delegation.  If you don't want delegation, omit this section,
# and replace all "subconf" commands with "include" in the rest of this
# document.

include "host-product-map.conf"
    # create this file; see step A1 in appendix A

repo gitolite-admin
    # now that you're adding a NAME/ section, you need this for master
    # admins to retain their access
    RW+ NAME/                   =   @master-admins

include "NAME-restrictions.conf"
    # create this file; see step A2 in appendix A

# (1.4)---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Now you include the access rules for native repos
# (example: master/sam.conf)

subconf "master/HOSTNAME.conf"

# (1.5)---------------------------------------------------------------------
# After this you have the mirror config for native repos.  We place this
# *after* the access rules above, to make sure we override any mirror
# config lines accidentally added by a host admin!
# (example: mirrors/sam/p1.conf)

include "mirrors/HOSTNAME/*.conf"

# (1.6)---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Now we pull in all setup (mirror config *and* access rules) for
# non-native repos.  For the product "p1", this file will get pulled in
# when the config is processed on frodo.
# (example: slave/frodo/sam.conf)

subconf "slave/HOSTNAME/*.conf"
</code></pre>

<p>You'll get some warnings about missing include files; ignore them.</p>

<p><a name="mirroring_complex_example_2_master_sam_conf__"></a></p>

<h3>(2) <code>master/sam.conf</code></h3>

<p>For each host sam, one file called <code>master/sam.conf</code> is needed.  This file
contains just one line:</p>

<pre><code>include "master/sam/*.conf"
</code></pre>

<p><font color="gray">It is pulled in by the main config file using <code>subconf
"master/HOSTNAME.conf"</code>, which -- on host sam -- translates to <code>subconf
"master/sam.conf"</code>.  The only purpose of this is to setup the subconf
restriction on the combined contents of <code>master/sam/*.conf</code>.</font></p>

<p><a name="mirroring_complex_example_3_host_admins_only_master_sam_p1_conf__"></a></p>

<h3>(3) host admins only -- <code>master/sam/p1.conf</code></h3>

<p>(recap: the host admins for sam can only write files in <code>master/sam</code>).</p>

<p>For each product p1 with master on host sam, the admins for host sam will
create a file <code>master/sam/p1.conf</code>.  This file will contain reponames (must
start with <code>p1/</code>) and access rules for these repos.</p>

<p>If they have some common groupnames etc., they can probably put them in
<code>master/sam/users.conf</code> or some such file and pull those in into each of their
product.conf files.</p>

<p>By default, everything is local to their server.  (Mirroring can only be setup
by the master admins).</p>

<p><a name="mirroring_complex_example_4_mirrors_sam_p1_conf__"></a></p>

<h3>(4) <code>mirrors/sam/p1.conf</code></h3>

<p>For each product p1 mastered on host sam, a file called <code>mirrors/sam/p1.conf</code>
will be created, containing mirror config lines for all repos of product p1.
In this case, it could be</p>

<pre><code>repo    p1/..*
        config gitolite.mirror.master   =   "sam"
        config gitolite.mirror.slaves   =   "frodo"
</code></pre>

<p>If this file does not exist, p1 is local to sam and not mirrored.</p>

<p><a name="mirroring_complex_example_5_slave_frodo_sam_conf__"></a></p>

<h3>(5) <code>slave/frodo/sam.conf</code></h3>

<p>For each product that slave frodo gets from master sam, this file has the
following lines</p>

<pre><code># pull in the access lines
include "master/sam/p1.conf"

# pull in the mirror config lines
include "mirrors/sam/p1.conf"
</code></pre>

<p><font color="gray">This file is pulled in on a slave server via a <code>subconf
slave/HOSTNAME/*.conf</code> line in the main config file.  On frodo, this would
pull in <code>slave/frodo/sam.conf</code> (among others), establishing, again, a subconf
restriction on <code>@sam</code>.</font></p>

<p><font color="gray">Security note: what this achieves is that the access lines,
which were written by sam's admins, are parsed on frodo <em>under the subconf
restriction of "sam"</em>.  This is important to prevent sam's admins from writing
rules for repos they don't own and having them processed on other
servers!</font></p>

<p><a name="mirroring_complex_example_6_manual_sync_"></a></p>

<h3>(6) manual sync</h3>

<p>The new repo(s) you just created would not have been synced up to frodo.  You
can either make an empty commit and push, or log on to sam and run</p>

<pre><code> gl-mirror-shell request-push p1/reponame
</code></pre>
