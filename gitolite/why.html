<p>Git by itself does not do any access control -- it relies on the transport medium to do authentication (&quot;who are you?&quot;), and on OS file permissions to do authorisation (&quot;what are you allowed to do?&quot;).</p>
<p>Git also comes with a program called &quot;git-shell&quot; which can act as a restricted login shell if you don't want users getting a proper shell. Using this and judicious use of Unix groups, you can allow some people read-only access while others get read-write access, etc. This is probably sufficient if your needs are simple and don't change too often.</p>
<p>However, gitolite does this much better, and offers many more features.</p>
<h1 id="basic-use-case"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> basic use case</h1>
<p>Gitolite is useful in any server that is going to host multiple git repositories, each with many developers, where &quot;anyone can do anything to any repo&quot; is not a good idea. Here're two examples to illustrate.</p>
<p>Example 1, 3 repos, 3 developers with different levels of access to each repo:</p>
<pre><code>repo foo
    RW+     =   alice
    R       =   bob

repo bar
    RW+     =   bob
    R       =   alice

repo baz
    RW+     =   carol
    R       =   alice bob</code></pre>
<p>Example 2, one repo, but different levels of access to different branches and tags for different developers:</p>
<pre><code>repo foo
    RW+ master                  =   alice
    RW+ dev/                    =   bob
    RW  refs/heads/tags/v[0-9]  =   ashok</code></pre>
<h1 id="alt"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> alternatives</h1>
<h2 id="unix-permissions-and-acls"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> unix permissions and ACLs</h2>
<p>If you're a masochist, you could probably do example 1 with Unix permissions and facls. But you can't do example 2 -- git is not designed to allow that!</p>
<p>Here are some other disadvantages of the Unix ACL method:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every user needs a userid and password on the server.</li>
<li>Changing access rights involves complex <code>usermod -G ...</code> mumblings (I.e., the &quot;pain&quot; mentioned above is not a one-time pain!)</li>
<li><em>Viewing</em> the current set of permissions requires running multiple commands to list directories and their permissions/ownerships, users and their group memberships, and then correlating all these manually.</li>
<li>Auditing historical permissions or permission changes is impossible.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="gcr"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Gerrit Code Review</h2>
<p>The best real alternative to gitolite is Gerrit Code Review. If code review is an essential part of your workflow, you should use Gerrit.</p>
<p>Here're some high level differences between gitolite and Gerrit:</p>
<p><strong>Size</strong>: 3000+ lines of perl versus of 56,000+ lines of Java</p>
<p><strong>Architecture</strong>: Gitolite sits on top of &quot;standard&quot; git and openssh, which are assumed to already be installed. Gerrit includes its own git stack (jgit) and sshd (Apache Mina). In Java tradition, they all come bundled together.</p>
<p>(Corollary: As far as I know jgit does not support the same hooks that 'man githooks' talks about).</p>
<p>Gitolite uses a plain text config file; gerrit uses a database.</p>
<p><strong>User view</strong>: Gitolite is invisible to users except when access is denied. I think Gerrit is much more visible to devs.</p>
<p>On a related note, gitolite does not do anything special with signed or annotated tags, nor does it check author/committer identity. However, it is trivial to add your own code to do either (or if someone contributes it, to just &quot;enable&quot; what ships with gitolite in a disabled state).</p>
<h2 id="gitorious-and-others"><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> gitorious and others</h2>
<p>Anecdotally, gitorious is very hard to install. Comparison with gitolite may be useless because I believe it doesn't have branch/tag level access control. However, I can't confirm or deny this because I can't find any documentation on the website. In addition, the main website hides the source code very well, so you already have a challenge! [The only link I could find was tucked away at the bottom of the About page, in the License section].</p>
<p>Gitorious has several, much newer, competitors offering web-based management, issue tracker, wiki, and so on; try googling for gitlab, gitblit, and rhodecode.</p>
<p>However, to the best of my knowledge none of them offer branch level access controls (please tell me if you know different), which, since it is the main reason I wrote gitolite, makes them all somewhat moot.</p>
<p>They are also unlikely to be as <a href="cust.html">customisable</a> as gitolite is, if you care about that sort of thing.</p>
