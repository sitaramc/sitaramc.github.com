<h2><a name="elsewhere"></a> putting 'repositories' and '.gitolite' somewhere else</h2>

<p>Gitolite insists that the "repositories" and ".gitolite" directories be in
<code>$HOME</code>.  If you want them somewhere else:</p>

<ul>
<li>do the install as normal,
</li>
<li><em>then</em> move those directories to wherever you want and replace them with
symlinks pointing to the new location.
</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="writable"></a> disabling pushes to take backups</h2>

<p>The <code>writable</code> command allows you to disable pushes to all repos or just the
named repo, in order to do file-system level things to the repo directory that
require it not to change, like using normal backup software.</p>

<p>Run <code>gitolite writable -h</code> for more info.</p>

<h2><a name="pers"></a> "personal" branches</h2>

<p>"personal" branches are great for environments where developers need to share
work but can't directly pull from each other (usually due to either a
networking or authentication related reason, both common in corporate setups).</p>

<p>Personal branches exist <strong>in a namespace</strong> of their own.  The syntax is</p>

<pre><code>    RW+ personal/USER/  =   @userlist
</code></pre>

<p>where the "personal" can be anything you like (but cannot be empty), and the
"/USER/" part is <strong>necessary (including both slashes)</strong>.</p>

<p>A user "alice" (if she's in the userlist) can then push any branches inside
<code>personal/alice/</code>.  Which means she can push <code>personal/alice/foo</code> and
<code>personal/alice/bar</code>, but NOT <code>personal/alice</code>.</p>

<p>(Background: at runtime the "USER" component will be replaced by the name of
the invoking user.  Access is determined by the right hand side, as usual).</p>

<p>Compared to using arbitrary branch names on the same server, this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reduces namespace pollution by corralling all these ad hoc branches into
the "personal/" namespace.
</li>
<li>Reduces branch name collision by giving each developer her own
sub-hierarchy within that.
</li>
<li>Removes the need to think about access control, because a user can push
only to his own sub-hierarchy.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>delegating access control responsibilities</h2>

<p>See <a href="deleg.html">this</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="keysonly"></a> using pubkeys obtained from elsewhere</h2>

<p>If you're not managing keys via the gitolite-admin repo, but getting them from
somewhere else, you'll want to periodically "update" the keys.</p>

<p>To do that, first edit your rc file and add something like this:</p>

<pre><code>SSH_AUTHKEYS                =&gt;
    [
        'post-compile/ssh-authkeys',
    ],
</code></pre>

<p>Then write a script that</p>

<ul>
<li><p>gets all the keys and dumps them into <code>$HOME/.gitolite/keydir</code> (or into a
subdirectory of it).</p></li>
<li><p>runs <code>gitolite trigger SSH_AUTHKEYS</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Run this from cron or however you want.</p>

<h2><a name="gh"></a> giving users their own repos</h2>

<p>(Please see <a href="wild.html">this</a> for background on the ideas in this section).</p>

<p>It's very easy to give users their own set of repos to create, with the
username at the top level.  The simplest setup is:</p>

<pre><code>repo CREATOR/..*
    C   =   @all
    RW+ =   CREATOR
    RW  =   WRITERS
    R   =   READERS
</code></pre>

<p>Now users can create any repo under their own name simply by cloning it or
pushing to it, then use the <a href="user.html#perms">perms</a> command to add other users to their
WRITERS and READERS lists.</p>

<p>Of course you can get much more creative if you add a few more roles (see
"roles" in <a href="wild.html">this</a> page).</p>

<p><font color="gray">(I prefer using some prefix, say "u", as in <code>repo
u/CREATOR/..*</code>.  This helps to keep user-created repos separate, and avoid
name clashes in some far-fetched scenarios).</font></p>
