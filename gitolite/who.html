<p>If you're using gitolite and find it very useful in some way, I would love to describe your use of it or add a link to your own description of it here. Of course, you can anonymise it as much as you need to.</p>

<p>The <strong>Fedora Project</strong> controls access to over 10,000 package management repositories accessed by over 1,000 package maintainers <a href="http://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/devel-announce/2010-July/000647.html">using gitolite</a>. This is probably the largest <em>confirmed</em> gitolite installation anywhere. The whole [big-config][bc] thing was initially done for them (their config file was so big that without the big-config changes gitolite would just run out of memory and die!).</p>
<p>The <strong>KDE project</strong> <a href="http://community.kde.org/Sysadmin/GitKdeOrgManual">uses</a> gitolite (in combination with redmine for issue tracking and reviewboard for code review). Apart from the usual access control, the KDE folks are heavy users of the &quot;ad hoc repo creation&quot; features enabled by wildrepos and the accompanying commands. Several of the changes to the &quot;admin defined commands&quot; were also inspired by KDE's needs. See <a href="http://community.kde.org/Sysadmin/GitKdeOrgManual#Server-side_commands">section 5</a> and <a href="http://community.kde.org/Sysadmin/GitKdeOrgManual#Personal_repositories">section 6</a> of the above linked page for details.</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Hiren Patel</strong> of the University of Waterloo is responsible for the existence of the fairly popular &quot;<a href="wild.html">wildrepos</a>&quot; feature. The documentation was pretty much written with his use case in mind, but of course it turns out to be useful for a lot of people, as you can see from the previous para on KDE's use of gitolite.</p>
<p>In fact, he surprised the heck out of me recently by saying that if it hadn't been for this feature, he might not have used git itself -- which is a pretty serious compliment if you think about the magnitude of the git project and my little one-man show!</p>
<p>He explains his use of it <a href="http://caesr.uwaterloo.ca/wildrepos-in-gitolite/">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Gentoo Linux</strong> has <a href="http://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-dev/msg_2812c9b9e768f64b46360ab17b9d0024.xml">just moved</a> their git repositories from gitosis to gitolite. There are about 200 repositories, some of them are the so called <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/overlays/">overlays</a>, official and unofficial/user overlays, plus several developer and project repositories, used by more than 1000 people. That number will be increased in the near future, as they are going to migrate some of their CVS/SVN repositories there, plus they are offering overlays hosting for users as well.</p>
<p><strong>kernel.org</strong>, the official distribution point for the Linux kernel, is the latest (as of 2011-10) high-visibility installation. According to <a href="http://lkml.org/lkml/2011/9/23/357">this email</a> to the lkml, kernel.org decided to use gitolite for access controlling their git repos. Their <a href="http://www.kernel.org/faq/#whygitolite">FAQ entry</a> describes at a high level why they chose gitolite.</p>
<p>This move also prompted the first ever security audit of gitolite by an outside party. Gitolite did great; see <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/gitolite/browse_thread/thread/8dc5242052b16d0f">here</a> for details.</p>
<p>In addition, kernel.org was responsible for a serious rethink of a few rough edges in gitolite, and smoothing them out was fun (the &quot;playing with gitolite&quot; stuff, making the test suite simpler, &quot;deny&quot; rules for the entire repo).</p>
<p>The <strong>Mageia Project</strong> is <a href="http://gitweb.mageia.org/">using</a> gitolite 3 to manage its git repositories and access control. The repositories are <a href="http://gitweb.mageia.org/infrastructure/repositories/software/">defined</a> in yaml files. A tool called <a href="http://gitweb.mageia.org/software/infrastructure/mgagit/">mgagit</a> has been created and is repsonsible for the generation of the gitolite configuration from the yaml repos definitions, and the extraction of users' ssh keys from an ldap directory into the gitolite configuration.</p>
<p>Gitolite and mgagit are installed using rpm packages and <a href="http://svnweb.mageia.org/adm/puppet/deployment/mgagit/">a puppet module</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>A general note: if you see the list of high-profile users above, you will see that gitolite benefits as much as they do; possibly more.</p>
<p>color me happy...</p>
