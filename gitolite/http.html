<h1>how to setup gitolite to use smart http mode</h1>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: "smart http" refers to the feature that came with git 1.6.6, late
2009 or so.  The base documentation for this is <code>man git-http-backend</code>.  Do
<strong>NOT</strong> read <code>Documentation/howto/setup-git-server-over-http.txt</code> and think
that is the same or even relevant -- that is from 2006 and is quite different
(and arguably obsolete).</p>

<h2>WARNINGS and important notes</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Please read <a href="auth.html">authentication versus authorisation</a> first, and make
sure you understand what is gitolite's responsibility and what isn't.</p></li>
<li><p>I have tested this only on stock Fedora 16; YDMV.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>assumptions:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Apache 2.x and git installed.
</li>
<li>Httpd runs under the "apache" userid; adjust instructions below if not.
</li>
<li>Similarly for "/var/www" and other file names/locations.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>instructions</h2>

<p>The detailed instructions I used to have in g2 have now been replaced by a
script called <code>t/smart-http.root-setup</code>.  <strong>Do NOT run this script as is -- it
is actually meant for my testing setup and deletes stuff</strong>.  However, it does
provide an excellent (and working!) narration of what you need to do to
install gitolite in smart http mode.</p>

<p>Make a copy of the script, go through it carefully, (possibly removing lines
that delete files etc.), change values per your system, and only then run it.</p>

<p><font color="gray">Note that the <code>GIT_PROJECT_ROOT</code> variable (see "man
git-http-backend") is no longer optional.  Make sure you set it to some place
outside apache's <code>DOCUMENT_ROOT</code>.</font></p>

<h2>Making repositories available to both ssh and http mode clients</h2>

<p>This section has been contributed by Thomas Hager (duke at sigsegv dot at),
and is available <a href="ssh-and-http.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2>usage</h2>

<h3>client side</h3>

<p>Git URLs look like <code>http://user:password@server/git/reponame.git</code>.</p>

<p>The custom commands, like "info", "expand" should be handled as follows.  The
command name will come just after the <code>/git/</code>, followed by a <code>?</code>, followed by
the arguments, with <code>+</code> representing a space.  Here are some examples:</p>

<pre><code># ssh git@server info
curl http://user:password@server/git/info
# ssh git@server info repopatt
curl http://user:password@server/git/info?repopatt
# ssh git@server info repopatt user1 user2
curl http://user:password@server/git/info?repopatt+user1+user2
</code></pre>

<p>With a few nice shell aliases, you won't even notice the horrible convolutions
here ;-)  See t/smart-http for a couple of useful ones.</p>

<h3>server side</h3>

<p>The 'gitolite' command (for example, 'gitolite compile', 'gitolite query-rc',
and so on) <em>can</em> be run on the server, but it's not straightforward.  Assuming
you installed exactly as given in this document, you should</p>

<ul>
<li>get a shell by using, say, <code>su -s /bin/bash - apache</code>
</li>
<li>run <code>export HOME=$HOME/gitolite-home</code>
</li>
<li>run <code>export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin</code>
</li>
</ul>

<p>and <em>then</em> you can run <code>gitolite &lt;subcommand&gt;</code></p>
