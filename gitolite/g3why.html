<h1 class="title">why a completely new version?</h1>
</div>
<p>Gitolite started life as 400 lines of perl written on a weekend because I was quickly losing control of my projects at work, exacerbated by git newbies doing all the wrong things. I really needed it!</p>
<p>That little 400 line thing is now a huge bunch of programs that do all sorts of things (I mean, rsync access control in a git related program? WTF!), because it kinda just <em>grew</em> while I wasn't looking.</p>
<p>So, briefly, here are the advantages of g3:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>compile versus everything else</p>
<p>g2's &quot;compile&quot; script was doing way, way too much. For example, dealing with gitweb and git-daemon was a good chunk of code in g2. In contrast, here's how g3 generates gitweb's projects.list file:</p>
<pre><code>(
    gitolite list-phy-repos | gitolite access % gitweb R any | grep -v DENIED
    gitolite list-phy-repos | gitolite git-config -r % gitweb\\.
) |
    cut -f1 | sort -u | sed -e 's/$/.git/' &gt; $plf</code></pre></li>
<li><p>core versus non-core</p>
<p>That's just the tip of the iceberg. The commands above run from a script that is itself outside gitolite, and can be enabled and disabled from the rc file. There are six different &quot;events&quot; within gitolite that can trigger external programs, with specific arguments passed to them, much like git's own hooks. The example you saw is called from the &quot;POST_COMPILE&quot; trigger.</p>
<p>And as you can see, these programs be in any language.</p></li>
<li><p>get/set perms/desc, and ADCs</p>
<p>I've always wanted to kick setperms out of core and make it an ADC. Sadly, it couldn't be done because when you update your repo's permissions using setperms, that can affect gitweb/daemon access, which -- you guessed right -- feeds back into the main code in complex ways. It <em>had</em> to be an &quot;inside job&quot;.</p>
<p>But now, the new 'perms' program is quite external to gitolite. And how does it fix up gitweb/daemon permissions after it is done updating the &quot;gl-perms&quot; file?</p>
<pre><code>system(&quot;gitolite&quot;, &quot;trigger&quot;, &quot;POST_CREATE&quot;);</code></pre></li>
<li><p>syntax versus semantics</p>
<p>I got tired of people asking things like &quot;why can't I have backslash-escaped continuation lines?&quot; I designed it differently because I don't like them but perhaps it's reasonable for some people.</p>
<p>Someone else wanted to use subdirectories of 'keydir' as group names. Why not?</p>
<p>G3 comes with a stackable set of &quot;syntactic sugar&quot; helpers. And you can write your own, though they do have to be in perl (because they're not standalone programs).</p>
<p>Once the code is written and placed in the right place, all you have to do to enable it is to uncomment some lines in the ENABLE list in the rc file:</p>
<pre><code># 'continuation-lines',
# 'keysubdirs-as-groups',
&lt;etc&gt;</code></pre></li>
<li><p>roll your own</p>
<p>Having a decent shell API helps enormously. You saw an example above but how about if your boss asks you &quot;I need a list of everyone who <em>currently</em> has read access to the 'foo' repo&quot;?</p>
<p>Sure you could look in conf/gitolite.conf, all its include files (if you have any), and if the repo is user-created, then in its gl-perms.</p>
<p>Or you could do something like this:</p>
<pre><code>gitolite list-users | gitolite access foo % R any | cut -f1</code></pre></li>
<li><p>over-engineered</p>
<p>g2 was, to some extent, over-engineered. One of the best examples is the documentation on hook-propagation in g2, which required even a <em>picture</em> to make clear (always a bad sign). In g3, the <a href="cust.html#hooks">hooks</a> section is 4 sentences.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway you get the idea.</p>
<p>The point is not that you can do all these cool tricks. The point is they are possible because of the redesign. There is no way on God's green earth I could have done this with the old code.</p>
