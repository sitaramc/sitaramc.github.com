<h1>gitolite and the (redis) cache</h1>

<p>There's now a branch of gitolite called "redis" that uses the Redis in-memory
key-value database to speed up some parts of gitolite.</p>

<p>To install it, just install redis, then the perl driver "Redis.pm".  Then
install this branch of gitolite in the normal manner.  Redis will start
automatically and the right things will happen (but see caveats below).</p>

<p>Support for this branch is limited to verifiable gitolite bugs, if you find
any; I can't help you with redis itself.</p>

<hr />

<p>First, the warnings/caveats.  If you ever kill the redis-server be sure to
also remove the socket file <code>~/.redis-gitolite.sock</code>.  Conversely if you ever
remove the sock file be sure to kill the process also.  Otherwise you get
weird behaviour, including possible hangs.  (If things don't seem to work, the
first thing to do is to kill all 'redis-server's on that userid and remove
<code>~/.redis-gitolite.*</code>, then try again.)</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: To the best of my knowledge, this cannot result in wrong data being
passed to gitolite, causing a security breach.  If anyone has time I'd
appreciate a review of the code -- it's not too big, the diff is only about
180 lines, and most of that is a new file of 140 or so lines.</p>

<h2>details</h2>

<p>During normal operation, (i.e., normal user executing a normal git operation
on a repo), there are a couple of places where gitolite is somewhat wasteful,
because each run, being a <em>separate</em> program, recomputes the same things.</p>

<p>The first instance of wasted effort occurs only in really large setups.  The
<code>~/.gitolite/conf/gitolite.conf-compiled.pm</code> file, which is read every time
gitolite is invoked, probably contains a lot of stuff that is not relevant to
the repo currently being accessed, and thus is a waste of time to parse.</p>

<p>Worse, for write operations this whole thing happens again, since the update
hook is, for all practical purposes, a completely separate program, and thus
has to read all the same stuff again.</p>

<p>(On the plus side, this is pure perl code, and perl <em>is</em> pretty fast, so
unless this file is larger than a couple of hundred kB it's probably not an
issue).</p>

<p>The second instance doesn't even need large setups, it's the complexity that
counts (although of course large <em>and</em> complex would make it a bit worse!)</p>

<p>Consider a conf like this:</p>

<pre><code># repo groups, foss and proprietary
@foss   =   linux git gitolite
@prop   =   foo-proj bar-proj baz-proj

# user groups
@boss   =   PHB
@lead   =   dilbert
@devs   =   alice
@ints   =   ashok
@QA     =   bob

repo @foss
    R                       =   @all
    -                       =   @all
    RW+ dev/USER/           =   @all
    RW+ company/            =   @devs
    RW+ refs/tags/company/  =   @devs
    RW  refs/tags/          =   @QA

repo @prop
    R                       =   @boss
    RW+                     =   @lead
    RW  master              =   @devs
    RW+ dev/USER/           =   @all
    RW  refs/tags/v[0-9]    =   @QA
    -   refs/tags/v[0-9]    =   @all
    RW+ refs/tags/          =   @devs
    RW+ refs/tags/USER/     =   @ints
</code></pre>

<p>When a specific user tries to access a specific repo, it takes some code to
come up with the exact list of rules that should be tested.  (Briefly, it
needs to consider group memberships of both repos and users [and the latter is
affected by the contents of the gl-perms file if it's a wild repo, and whether
he's the creator or not!], as well as any wild card patterns that match the
repo, and bring all those rules together in the right sequence).</p>

<p>So what this version of gitolite does is simply cache the ruleset for every
repo-user combination that is access-checked.  That's it.  The next time the
same user tries to access the same repo, all that code is bypassed.</p>

<p>On my laptop, the figures are 150 milliseconds versus 0.6 milliseconds.
The ssh connection and perl startup are about 200 and 80 milliseconds
respectively, so you've shaved 33% off of each read attempt, and 50% off of
each write!</p>

<p>Across tens of thousands of access attempts, this adds up!  And the longer the
system is up, the higher the hit-rate, which is great!</p>

<p>That's the <strong>good news</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>bad news</strong> is that there are some situations in which the cache is
flushed, bringing your system back to square one until it has built up the
cache again:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>every time 'gitolite compile' runs (e.g., when you push the admin repo)</p>

<p>So if frequent pushes to gitolite-admin are the cause of your problem,
this won't help you.  In fact, it'll make it worse, because any access
that misses the cache now takes <em>more</em> time than before (the normal time,
plus time to update the cache).</p></li>
<li><p>every time the owner of a wild repo touches the gl-perms file, all rules
for this specific repo are flushed (not the entire cache, though, so
that's not too bad).</p></li>
<li><p>finally, and worst of all, if you have defined an external program
(<code>GROUPLIST_PGM</code>) to supply a list of groups a given user belongs to, all
cache entries are only saved for 60 seconds, instead of the normal 9999
seconds (just over a day).  This is because something outside out control
could change group memberships and if a user's group list changes, so does
the applicable ruleset.</p>

<p>You can set <code>CACHE_TTL</code> in the rc file to some larger value if you know
that your external group list data does not change that often, or that
even if it does, it's ok to run with a stale group list for a user for
some time.  But it probably won't be smart to make it 9999 :-(</p></li>
</ul>
