<h1>delegating access control responsibilities</h1>

<p>Delegation allows you to divide up a large conf file into smaller groups of
repos (called <strong>subconf</strong>s) and hand over responsibility to manage them to
<strong>sub-admin</strong>s.  Gitolite can prevent one sub-admin from being able to set
access rules for any other sub-admin's repos.</p>

<p>Delegation is achieved by combining two gitolite features: <a href="deleg.html#subconf">subconf</a> and the
<a href="vref.html#NAME">NAME VREF</a>.</p>

<p>To understand delegation, read both those links then come back to this
example.</p>

<h2>example</h2>

<pre><code>@webbrowsers        = firefox lynx browsers/..*
@webservers         = apache nginx servers/..*
@malwares           = conficker storm ms/..*
    # side note: if anyone objects, we claim ms stands for "metasploit" ;-)

# the admin repo access was probably like this to start with:
repo gitolite-admin
    RW+                                     = sitaram
# now add these lines to the config for the admin repo
    RW                                      = alice bob mallory
    RW  VREF/NAME/conf/subs/webbrowsers     = alice
    RW  VREF/NAME/conf/subs/webservers      = bob
    RW  VREF/NAME/conf/subs/malwares        = mallory
    -   VREF/NAME/                          = alice bob mallory
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, you tell gitolite to pull in these files using the "subconf" command</p>

<pre><code>subconf "subs/*.conf"
</code></pre>

<p>And that's it.</p>

<h2><a name="subconf"></a> the subconf command</h2>

<p>Subconf is exactly like the include command in syntax:</p>

<pre><code>subconf "foo.conf"
</code></pre>

<p>but while reading the included file (as well as anything included from it),
gitolite sets the "subconf name" to "foo".</p>

<p>A "subconf" imposes some restrictions on what repos can be managed.</p>

<p>For example, while the subconf name is "foo", as in the above example,
gitolite will only process "repo" lines for:</p>

<ul>
<li>A repo called "foo".
</li>
<li>A group called "@foo", as long as the group is defined in the main conf
file (i.e., <em>outside</em> "foo.conf").
</li>
<li>A member of a group called "@foo" (again, defined outside).
</li>
<li>A repo that matches a member of a group called "@foo" if that member is a
regular expression pattern.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's an example.  If the main conf file contains</p>

<pre><code>@foo    =   aa bb cc/..*
</code></pre>

<p>then the subconf can only accept repo statements that refer to 'foo', '@foo',
'aa', 'bb', or any repo whose name starts with 'cc/'.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: the subconf name "master" is special; it is the default subconf in
effect for the main conf file and has no restrictions.</p>

<h3>how the "subconf name" is derived</h3>

<p>For subconf lines that look just like include statements, i.e.,</p>

<pre><code>subconf "foo/bar.conf"
subconf "frob/*.conf"
    # assume frob has files aa.conf, bb.conf
</code></pre>

<p>the subconf name as each file is being processed is the base name of the file.
This means it would be "bar" for the first line, "aa" when processing
"frob/aa.conf", and "bb" when processing "frob/bb.conf".</p>

<p>A variation of subconf exists that can explicitly state the subconf name:</p>

<pre><code>subconf foo "frob/*.conf"
</code></pre>

<p>In this variation, regardless of what file in "frob/" is being read, the
subconf name in effect is "foo".</p>

<h2>security notes</h2>

<h3>group names</h3>

<p>You can use "@group"s defined in the main config file but do not attempt to
redefine or extend them in your own subconf file.  If you must extend a group
(say <code>@foo</code>) defined in the main config file, do this:</p>

<pre><code>@myfoo  =   @foo
# now do whatever you want with @myfoo
</code></pre>

<p>Group names you define in your subconf will not clash even if the exact same
name is used in another subconf file, so you need not worry about that.</p>

<h3>delegating pubkeys</h3>

<p>Short answer: not gonna happen.</p>

<p>The delegation feature is meant only for access control rules, not pubkeys.
Adding/removing pubkeys is a much more significant event than changing branch
level permissions for people already on staff, and only the main admin should
be allowed to do it.</p>

<p>Gitolite's "userids" all live in the same namespace.  This is unlikely to
change, so please don't ask -- it gets real complicated to do otherwise.
Allowing sub-admins to add users means username collisions, which also means
security problems (admin-A creates a pubkey for Admin-B, thus gaining access
to all of Admin-B's stuff).</p>

<p>If you feel the need to delegate even that, please just go the whole hog and
give them separate gitolite instances (i.e., running under different gitolite
hosting users)!</p>
