<h1 class="title">delegating access control responsibilities</h1>
</div>
<p>Delegation allows you to divide up a large conf file into smaller groups of repos (called <strong>subconf</strong>s) and hand over responsibility to manage them to <strong>sub-admin</strong>s. Gitolite can prevent one sub-admin from being able to set access rules for any other sub-admin's repos.</p>
<p>Delegation is achieved by combining two gitolite features: <a href="deleg.html#subconf">subconf</a> and the <a href="vref.html#NAME">NAME VREF</a>.</p>
<p>To understand delegation, read both those links then come back to this example.</p>
<h1 id="example"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> example</h1>
<pre><code>@webbrowsers        = firefox lynx browsers/..*
@webservers         = apache nginx servers/..*
@malwares           = conficker storm ms/..*
    # side note: if anyone objects, we claim ms stands for &quot;metasploit&quot; ;-)

# the admin repo access was probably like this to start with:
repo gitolite-admin
    RW+                                     = sitaram
# now add these lines to the config for the admin repo
    RW                                      = alice bob mallory
    RW  VREF/NAME/conf/subs/webbrowsers     = alice
    RW  VREF/NAME/conf/subs/webservers      = bob
    RW  VREF/NAME/conf/subs/malwares        = mallory
    -   VREF/NAME/                          = alice bob mallory</code></pre>
<p>Finally, you tell gitolite to pull in these files using the &quot;subconf&quot; command</p>
<pre><code>subconf &quot;subs/*.conf&quot;</code></pre>
<p>And that's it.</p>
<h1 id="subconf"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> the subconf command</h1>
<p>Subconf is exactly like the include command in syntax:</p>
<pre><code>subconf &quot;foo.conf&quot;</code></pre>
<p>but while reading the included file (as well as anything included from it), gitolite sets the &quot;subconf name&quot; to &quot;foo&quot;.</p>
<p>A &quot;subconf&quot; imposes some restrictions on what repos can be managed.</p>
<p>For example, while the subconf name is &quot;foo&quot;, as in the above example, gitolite will only process &quot;repo&quot; lines for:</p>
<ul>
<li>A repo called &quot;foo&quot;.</li>
<li>A group called &quot;<span class="citation">@foo</span>&quot;, as long as the group is defined in the main conf file (i.e., <em>outside</em> &quot;foo.conf&quot;).</li>
<li>A member of a group called &quot;<span class="citation">@foo</span>&quot; (again, defined outside).</li>
<li>A repo that matches a member of a group called &quot;<span class="citation">@foo</span>&quot; if that member is a regular expression pattern.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's an example. If the main conf file contains</p>
<pre><code>@foo    =   aa bb cc/..*</code></pre>
<p>then the subconf can only accept repo statements that refer to 'foo', '<span class="citation">@foo</span>', 'aa', 'bb', or any repo whose name starts with 'cc/'.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: the subconf name &quot;master&quot; is special; it is the default subconf in effect for the main conf file and has no restrictions.</p>
<h2 id="how-the-subconf-name-is-derived"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> how the &quot;subconf name&quot; is derived</h2>
<p>For subconf lines that look just like include statements, i.e.,</p>
<pre><code>subconf &quot;foo/bar.conf&quot;
subconf &quot;frob/*.conf&quot;
    # assume frob has files aa.conf, bb.conf</code></pre>
<p>the subconf name as each file is being processed is the base name of the file. This means it would be &quot;bar&quot; for the first line, &quot;aa&quot; when processing &quot;frob/aa.conf&quot;, and &quot;bb&quot; when processing &quot;frob/bb.conf&quot;.</p>
<p>A variation of subconf exists that can explicitly state the subconf name:</p>
<pre><code>subconf foo &quot;frob/*.conf&quot;</code></pre>
<p>In this variation, regardless of what file in &quot;frob/&quot; is being read, the subconf name in effect is &quot;foo&quot;.</p>
<h1 id="security-notes"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> security notes</h1>
<h2 id="group-names"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> group names</h2>
<p>You can use &quot;<span class="citation">@group</span>&quot;s defined in the main config file but do not attempt to redefine or extend them in your own subconf file. If you must extend a group (say <code>@foo</code>) defined in the main config file, do this:</p>
<pre><code>@myfoo  =   @foo
# now do whatever you want with @myfoo</code></pre>
<p>Group names you define in your subconf will not clash even if the exact same name is used in another subconf file, so you need not worry about that.</p>
<h2 id="delegating-pubkeys"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> delegating pubkeys</h2>
<p>Short answer: not gonna happen.</p>
<p>The delegation feature is meant only for access control rules, not pubkeys. Adding/removing pubkeys is a much more significant event than changing branch level permissions for people already on staff, and only the main admin should be allowed to do it.</p>
<p>Gitolite's &quot;userids&quot; all live in the same namespace. This is unlikely to change, so please don't ask -- it gets real complicated to do otherwise. Allowing sub-admins to add users means username collisions, which also means security problems (admin-A creates a pubkey for Admin-B, thus gaining access to all of Admin-B's stuff).</p>
<p>If you feel the need to delegate even that, please just go the whole hog and give them separate gitolite instances (i.e., running under different gitolite hosting users)!</p>
