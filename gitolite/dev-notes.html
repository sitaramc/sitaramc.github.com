<p>Gitolite has a huge bunch of existing features that gradually need to be moved over. Plus you may want to write your own programs to interact with it.</p>
<p><strong>This document is about <em>writing</em> hooks, commands, triggers, VREFS, and sugar scripts. <em>Installing</em> them, including &quot;where and how&quot;, is described <a href="cust.html#localcode">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Note: the <a href="cust.html">customisation</a> document is the starting point for all information about customising gitolite.</p>
<h1 id="environment-variables-and-other-inputs"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> environment variables and other inputs</h1>
<p>In general, the following environment variables should always be available:</p>
<pre><code>GL_BINDIR
GL_REPO_BASE
GL_ADMIN_BASE</code></pre>
<p>In addition, commands invoked by a remote client also have <code>GL_USER</code>, while hooks have <code>GL_USER</code> as well as <code>GL_REPO</code>.</p>
<p>A special form of the <a href="options.html">option</a> syntax can be used to set <a href="dev-notes.html#rsev">repo-specific environment variables</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, note that triggers get a lot of relevant information from gitolite as arguments; see <a href="triggers.html">here</a> for details.</p>
<h1 id="apis"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> APIs</h1>
<h2 id="the-shell-api"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> the shell API</h2>
<p>The following commands exist to help you write shell scripts that interact easily with gitolite. Each of them responds to <code>-h</code> so please run that for more info.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>gitolite access</code> to check access rights given repo, user, type of access (R, W, ...) and refname (optional). Example use: src/commands/desc.</p></li>
<li><p><code>gitolite creator</code> to get/check the creator of a repo. Example use: src/commands/desc.</p></li>
<li><p><code>gitolite git-config</code> to check gitolite options or git config variables directly from gitolite's &quot;compiled&quot; output, (i.e., without looking at the actual <code>repo.git/config</code> file or using the <code>git config</code> command). Example use: src/triggers/post-compile/update-gitweb-access-list.</p></li>
<li><p><code>gitolite query-rc</code> to check the value of an RC variable. Example use: src/commands/desc.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, you can also look at the comments in src/lib/Gitolite/Easy.pm (the perl API module) for ideas.</p>
<h2 id="the-perl-api"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> the perl API</h2>
<p>...is implemented by Gitolite::Easy; the comments in src/lib/Gitolite/Easy.pm serve as documentation.</p>
<p>Note that some of the perl functions called by Easy.pm will change the current directory to something else, without saving and restoring the directory. Patches (to Easy.pm <em>only</em>) welcome.</p>
<h1 id="writing-your-own..."><span class="header-section-number">3</span> writing your own...</h1>
<h2 id="commands"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> ...commands</h2>
<p>Commands are standalone programs, in any language you like. They simply receive the arguments you append. In addition, the env var <code>GL_USER</code> is available if it is being run remotely. src/commands/desc is the best example at present.</p>
<h2 id="hooks"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> ...hooks</h2>
<h3 id="anything-but-the-update-hook"><span class="header-section-number">3.2.1</span> anything but the update hook</h3>
<p>If you want to add any hook other than the update hook, 'man githooks' is all you need.</p>
<h3 id="update-hook"><span class="header-section-number">3.2.2</span> update hook</h3>
<p>If you want to add additional <code>update</code> hook functionality, do this:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Write and test your update hook separately from gitolite.</p></li>
<li><p>Now add the code as a VREF (see <a href="cust.html#localcode">here</a> for details). Let's say you called it &quot;foo&quot;.</p>
<p>NOTE: if you don't care about all the extra stuff that VREFs give you over a normal update hook, you don't have to read that document at all; just put the code in the right place and go to the next step.</p></li>
<li><p>To call your new update hook to all accesses for all repos, add this to the end of your conf file:</p>
<pre><code>repo @all
    -       VREF/foo        =   @all</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<p>As you probably guessed, you can make your additional update hooks more selective, applying them only to some repos / users / combinations.</p>
<p>Note: a normal update hook expects 3 arguments (ref, old SHA, new SHA). A VREF will get those three, followed by at least 4 more. Your VREF should just ignore the extra args.</p>
<h2 id="trigger-programs"><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> ...trigger programs</h2>
<p>Trigger programs run at specific points in gitolite's execution, with specific arguments being passed to them. See the <a href="triggers.html">triggers</a> page for details.</p>
<p>You can write programs that are both manually runnable as well as callable by trigger events, especially if they don't <em>need</em> any arguments.</p>
<h2 id="sugar"><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> ...&quot;sugar&quot;</h2>
<p>Syntactic sugar helpers are NOT complete, standalone, programs. They must include a perl sub called <code>sugar_script</code> that takes in a listref, and returns a listref. The listrefs point to a list that contains the entire conf file (with all <a href="syntax.html#include">include</a> processing already done). You create a new list with contents modified as you like and return a ref to it.</p>
<p>There are a couple of examples in src/syntactic-sugar.</p>
<h1 id="appendix-1-notes-on-the-input-trigger"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> appendix 1: notes on the INPUT trigger</h1>
<p>Note: some of this won't make sense if you haven't read about <a href="triggers.html">triggers</a>.</p>
<p>The INPUT trigger sequence is designed to set or change environment variables or the argument list. (Side note: this means INPUT triggers have to be written as perl modules; they cannot be standalone scripts). This is a very powerful idea so an extended description may be useful.</p>
<p>Sshd invokes gitolite-shell with the SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND env var containing the git/gitolite command and one argument: the gitolite username.</p>
<ul>
<li>see <a href="glssh.html">this</a> for details on the latter</li>
<li>the <em>first</em> thing gitolite does in smart http mode is to use the REMOTE_USER and the CGI variables that apache provides to <em>construct</em> a fake argument list and a fake SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND env var, so the rest of the code can stay the same</li>
</ul>
<p>The INPUT trigger is then run. The purpose of the input trigger is to ensure that the first argument <em>is</em> the gitolite username, and that the SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND env var contains the actual command to execute. It can also be used to set up any other environment variables that you may decide you need.</p>
<p>Wait... didn't we say that's what gitolite-shell gets anyway, just now?</p>
<p>Well, we lied a bit there; it's not always true!</p>
<p>For example, if <a href="sts.html#giving-shell">this</a> feature is used, the first argument <em>may</em> be &quot;-s&quot;, with the username in the <em>second</em> argument. Shell.pm deals with that. <font color="gray">(Order matters. If you use this feature, put the <code>'Shell::input',</code> line ahead of the others, since it is the only one prepared to deal with username not being the first argument).</font></p>
<p>If you look at CpuTime.pm, you'll see that it's <code>input()</code> function doesn't set or change anything, but does set a package variable to record the start time. Later, when the same module's <code>post_git()</code> function is invoked, it uses this variable to determine elapsed time.</p>
<p><em>(This is a very nice and simple example of how you can implement features by latching onto multiple events and sharing data to do something)</em>.</p>
<p>You can even change the reponame the user sees, behind his back. Alias.pm handles that.</p>
<p>Finally, as an exercise for the reader, consider how you would create a brand new env var that contains the <em>comment</em> field of the ssh pubkey that was used to gain access, using the information <a href="sts.html#kfn">here</a>.</p>
<h1 id="rsev"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> appendix 2: repo-specific environment variables</h1>
<p>A special form of the <a href="options.html">option</a> syntax can be used to set repo-specific environment variables that are visible to gitolite triggers and any git hooks you may install.</p>
<p>For example, let's say you installed a post-update hook that initiates a CI job. By default, of course, this hook will be active for <em>all</em> gitolite-managed repos. However, you only want it to run for some specific repos, say r1, r2, and r4.</p>
<p>To do that, first add this to the gitolite.conf:</p>
<pre><code>repo r1 r2 r4
    option ENV.CI = 1</code></pre>
<p>This creates an environment variable called <code>GL_OPTION_CI</code> with the value 1, before any trigger or hook is invoked.</p>
<p>Note: option names <em>must</em> start with <code>ENV.</code>, followed by a seqence of characters composed of alphas, numbers, and the underscore character.</p>
<p>Now the hook running the CI job can easily decide what to do:</p>
<pre><code># exit if $GL_OPTION_CI is not set
[ -z $GL_OPTION_CI ] &amp;&amp; exit

... rest of CI job code as before ...</code></pre>
<p>Of course you can also do the opposite; i.e. decide that the listed repos should <em>not</em> run the CI job but all other repos should:</p>
<pre><code>repo @all
    option ENV.CI = 1

repo r1 r2 r4
    option ENV.CI = &quot;&quot;</code></pre>
<p>(The hook code remains the same as before.)</p>
<p><font color="gray">Before this feature was added, you could still do this, by using the <code>gitolite git-config</code> command inside the hook code to test for options and configs set for the repo, like:</p>
<pre><code>if gitolite git-config -q reponame gitolite-options.option-name
then
    ...</code></pre>
<p>The new method is much more convenient, as you can see.</font></p>
<h1 id="lff"><span class="header-section-number">6</span> appendix 3: log file format</h1>
<p>Here's a brief description of gitolite's log file format. All fields are tab separated.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of lines in the log file:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>third field non-empty: actual log lines. These are documented below.</p></li>
<li><p>third field empty (i.e., two tabs after the second field): informational output. These are NOT documented and may change without notice. They can be turned off completely by setting the RC variable <code>LOG_EXTRA</code> to 0.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For all types of log lines, the first two fields are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>field 1: local time, in YYYY-MM-DD.HH:MM:SS format</p></li>
<li><p>field 2: transaction ID or &quot;TID&quot;. This is actually the PID of the outermost command that was initiated (usually &quot;gitolite-shell&quot;). It helps to keep log lines pertaining to one &quot;run&quot; together, even if several sub-commands are spawned (like for example from triggers, or even the update hook itself).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The third and later fields are all dependent on what type of log line it is.</p>
<p>The various log line formats are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>start</strong></p>
<p>This line denotes the beginning of a gitolite operation.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>field 3: 'ssh' or 'http'</p></li>
<li><p>field 4: <code>ARGV=&lt;comma-separated list of command line arguments&gt;</code></p>
<p>Usually this is just the gitolite username (the argument to gitolite-shell, as supplied by the forced command in the authorized keys file). If you're <a href="sts.html#giving-shell">giving shell access</a> to some users, this would be &quot;-s,username&quot;. That's two command line arguments (&quot;-s&quot; and the username), comma separated.</p></li>
<li><p>field 5: <code>SOC=&lt;original command from client&gt;</code></p>
<p>This is the command exactly as the git client sent it, or the user typed it. Typically this is one of these:</p>
<pre><code>git-upload-pack 'reponame'
git-receive-pack 'reponame'</code></pre>
<p>(including the single quotes, because that's what the client sent).</p>
<p>Gitolite commands are also recorded as is, so this could be something like <code>info</code> or perhaps <code>perms -l reponame</code> etc.</p></li>
<li><p>field 6: <code>FROM=&lt;ip address&gt;</code></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>pre-git</strong></p>
<p>This log line appears when the first access check succeeds (i.e., before git-upload-pack or git-receive-pack is called).</p>
<ul>
<li>field 3: 'pre_git'</li>
<li>field 4: reponame</li>
<li>field 5: username</li>
<li>field 6: 'R' or 'W'</li>
<li>field 7: 'any'</li>
<li>field 8: the refex that allowed access</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>update</strong></p>
<p>This log line appears when the second access check succeeds (i.e., when the update hook decides to allow the push).</p>
<ul>
<li>field 3: 'update'</li>
<li>field 4: reponame</li>
<li>field 5: username</li>
<li>field 6: 'W', '+', 'C', 'D', 'WM', '+M', 'CM', or 'DM'</li>
<li>field 7: ref name (like 'refs/heads/master')</li>
<li>field 8: old SHA</li>
<li>field 9: new SHA</li>
<li>field 10: the refex that allowed access</li>
</ul>
<p>The values in field 6 reflect the possible <a href="write-types.html">write types</a>, but note that there is a difference between what the log file contains and what the gitolite.conf file contains (e.g., <code>+</code> versus <code>RW+</code>). There's another subtle difference for those who are not thinking clearly: the <code>RW+</code> in the conf file is a permission, but it would show up as a <code>+</code> in the log file only if an <em>actual</em> force push had happened, otherwise it would be just <code>W</code>.</p>
<p>By the way, notice that fields 7 to 9 are exactly what git itself supplies the update hook (see 'man githooks').</p>
<p><font color="gray">There is a special version of this line that appears when someone <a href="emergencies.html#bypass">bypasses</a> gitolite's access control to push directly on the server. The 'reponame' (field 4) is replaced by the full path of the repo being pushed to, the username (field 5) is replaced by the Unix userid in parentheses, and the operation code (field 6) is 'bypass'.</font></p></li>
<li><p><strong>create</strong></p>
<p>This log line appears when a wild repo was auto-created by a user.</p>
<ul>
<li>field 3: 'create'</li>
<li>field 4: reponame</li>
<li>field 5: username</li>
<li>field 6: 'R' or 'W'</li>
</ul>
<p>Field 6 is 'perms-c' if the wild repo is created using the perms command's '-c' option.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>end</strong></p>
<p>This indicates the end of the transaction. Normally, you should not see any more lines with the same TID after this line.</p>
<ul>
<li>field 3: 'END'</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>warnings</strong> and <strong>errors</strong></p>
<p>Typically seen when access is denied.</p>
<ul>
<li>field 3: 'warn' or 'die'</li>
<li>field 4: message. Parts of the message (like reponame, username, etc) are not split out into fields, though.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>cli</strong></p>
<p>This logs gitolite sub-commands run directly on the server, like <code>gitolite setup</code> etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>field 3: 'cli'</li>
<li>field 4: 'gitolite'</li>
<li>field 5 to end: arguments supplied to gitolite command, one per field</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
