<font color="gray">This is for gitolite &quot;g3&quot;; for older (v2.x) documentation click <a href="http://sitaramc.github.com/gitolite/g2/master-toc.html">here</a></font>
</p>
<div id="header">
<h1 class="title">the &quot;rc&quot; file (<code>$HOME/.gitolite.rc</code>)</h1>
</div>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: if you have a v3.0-v3.3 rc file it will still work. In fact internally the v3.4 rc file data gets converted to the v3.3 format. So just because you upgraded gitolite doesn't mean you have to change your rc file!</p>
<p><strong>v3.3 or before</strong>: <a href="rc-33.html">this</a> is the document you need.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE 2</strong>: if you're migrating from g2, there are some settings that MUST be dealt with <strong>before</strong> running <code>gitolite setup</code>; please read the <a href="migr.html">migration</a> page and linked pages, and especially the one on &quot;presetting the rc file&quot;</p>
<hr />
<p>The rc file for g3 is <em>quite</em> different from that of g2. The change affects <a href="triggers.html">triggers</a> more than anything else, and to a very small extent <a href="cust.html#commands">commands</a>. Please see those links for details, especially if you want to add your own triggers or commands.</p>
<p>As before, it is designed to be the only thing unique to your site for most setups. What is new is that it is easy to extend it when new needs come up, without having to touch core gitolite.</p>
<p>The rc file is perl code, but you do NOT need to know perl to edit it. Just mind the commas, use single quotes unless you know what you're doing, and make sure the brackets and braces stay matched up!</p>
<p>Please look at the <code>~/.gitolite.rc</code> file that gets installed when you setup gitolite. As you can see there are 3 types of variables in it:</p>
<ul>
<li>a lot of simple variables (like <code>UMASK</code>, <code>GIT_CONFIG_KEYS</code>, etc)</li>
<li>a hash or two (like <code>ROLES</code>)</li>
<li>and one large list of features to be enabled (<code>ENABLE</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>While some of the variables are documented in this file, many of them are not. Their purposes are to be found in each of their individual documentation files around; start with <a href="cust.html">customising gitolite</a>. If a setting is used by an external command then running that command with '-h' may give you additional information.</p>
<h1 id="specific-variables"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> specific variables</h1>
<ul>
<li><p><code>$UMASK</code>, octal, default <code>0077</code></p>
<p>The default UMASK that gitolite uses makes all the repos and their contents have <code>rwx------</code> permissions. People who want to run gitweb (or cgit, redmine, etc) realise that this will not do.</p>
<p>The correct way to deal with this is to give this variable a value like <code>0027</code> (note the syntax: the leading 0 is required), and then make the user running the webserver (apache, www-data, whatever) a member of the 'git' group.</p>
<p>If you've already installed gitolite then existing files will have to be fixed up manually (for a umask or 0027, that would be <code>chmod -R g+rX</code>). This is because umask only affects permissions on newly created files, not existing ones.</p></li>
<li><p><code>$GIT_CONFIG_KEYS</code>, string, default empty</p>
<p>This setting allows the repo admin to define acceptable gitconfig keys.</p>
<p>Gitolite allows you to set git config values using the &quot;config&quot; keyword; see <a href="git-config.html">here</a> for details and syntax.</p>
<p>However, if you are in an installation where the repo admin does not (and should not) have shell access to the server, then allowing him to set arbitrary repo config options <em>may</em> be a security risk -- some config settings allow executing arbitrary commands!</p>
<p>You have 3 choices. By default <code>$GIT_CONFIG_KEYS</code> is left empty, which completely disables this feature (meaning you cannot set git configs via the repo config).</p>
<p>The second choice is to give it a space separated list of settings you consider safe. (These are actually treated as a set of <a href="regex.html">regular expression</a> patterns, and any one of them must match).</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>$GIT_CONFIG_KEYS = 'core\.logAllRefUpdates core\..*compression';</code></pre>
<p>Each pattern should match the <em>whole</em> key (in other words, there is an implicit <code>^</code> at the start of each pattern, and a <code>$</code> at the end).</p>
<p>The third choice (which you may have guessed already if you're familiar with regular expressions) is to allow anything and everything: <code>$GIT_CONFIG_KEYS = '.*';</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>ROLES</code>, hash, default keys 'READERS' and 'WRITERS'</p>
<p>This specifies the role names allowed to be used by users running the <a href="user.html#perms">perms</a> command. The <a href="wild.html">wild</a> repos doc has more info on roles.</p></li>
<li><p><code>OWNER_ROLENAME</code>, string, default undef</p>
<p>(requires v3.5 or later)</p>
<p>By default, permissions on a wild repo can only be set by the <em>creator</em> of the repo (using the <a href="user.html#perms">perms</a> command). But some sites want to allow other people to do this as well.</p>
<p>To enable this behaviour, the server admin must first set this variable to some string, say 'OWNERS'. (He must also add 'OWNERS' to the ROLES hash described in the previous bullet).</p>
<p>The creator of the repo can then add other users to the OWNERS role using the <a href="user.html#perms">perms</a> command.</p>
<p>The <a href="user.html#perms">perms</a> command, the new &quot;owns&quot; command, and possibly other commands in future, will then give these users the same privileges that they give to the creator of the repo.</p>
<p>(Also see the full documentation on <a href="wild.html#roles">roles</a>).</p></li>
<li><p><code>LOCAL_CODE</code>, string</p>
<p>This is described in more detail <a href="cust.html#localcode">here</a>. Please be aware <strong>this must be a FULL path</strong>, not a relative path.</p></li>
</ul>
