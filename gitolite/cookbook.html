<h1>gitolite cookbook</h1>

<p>Documentation is meant to be as complete as possible, which means it attempts
to cover all situations and scenarios.  That makes it harder to read.</p>

<p>However, if you make some assumptions, remove the rationale, justification,
exceptions and special cases, etc., and generally just say <em>what</em> is to be
done rather than explain <em>why</em>, many tasks can be described very easily.</p>

<p>Maybe this will help.  If you run into problems, please check the main
documentation before asking for help.  In particular, the <a href="basic.html">basic</a> and
<a href="advanced.html">advanced</a> graphical overviews of the documentation may be useful.</p>

<h2><a name="cb-admin"></a> administration</h2>

<h3>separating "key admin" from "repo admin"</h3>

<p>In gitolite, the person who controls the keys is the most powerful -- because
he can always add his own key in your name :-)</p>

<p>Traditionally, the same person also administers repos and permissions.  But
sometimes you want to separate them.  The following should work:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>put the following in conf/gitolite.conf:</p>

<pre><code>repo gitolite-admin
    RW+ = key-manager repo-manager


<pre><code>RW+ VREF/NAME/                    = key-manager
-   VREF/NAME/keydir/             = @all
-   VREF/NAME/conf/gitolite.conf  = @all
</code></pre>

include "actual.conf"
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>then let the repo-manager manage everything through "actual.conf".</p></li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="cb-access"></a> access</h2>

<h3>looking up repo access from external tools</h3>

<p>There are two supported interfaces for this, one in perl and one in shell.
Other languages should probably use the shell mode.  (The shell mode has a
very convenient "batch" mode if you need to check many repos at once).</p>

<p><strong>Perl interface</strong>: A good intro to this, including a link to code, using
gitweb as an example can be found by looking for 'repo-specific authorisation
in gitweb' in the page on <a href="external.html">interfacing with external tools</a>.  Some
notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>be sure to read the comments in the code to learn exactly how to adapt it
to your needs
</li>
<li>in place of the <code>can_read</code> function in that code, you can of course use
<code>can_write</code>.  In fact, reading the comments in "Easy.pm" (look for it in
the source) shows you several other interesting tests you can make, like
<code>is_admin</code>, <code>in_group</code>, and <code>owns</code>.
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Shell interface</strong>: If you want to do this from shell, it's just even easier.
The same "Easy.pm" source contains comments that show shell equivalents for
each of the functions it exports, but here's a sample:</p>

<pre><code>if gitolite access -q reponame username W
then
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>You can even test for access to specific branches:</p>

<pre><code>if gitolite access -q reponame username W refs/heads/master
then
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>(note that you must use the full ref name; just 'master' won't do).</p>

<h3>providing access to external tools</h3>

<p>Giving external tools (like apache) access to gitolite repositories involves
making sure that the unix owner/group and permissions settings allow this.
This is all described in the UMASK section in the documentation on the <a href="rc.html">rc
file</a>, because that's the only setting that gitolite controls; every thing
else is pure Unix.</p>

<h2><a name="cb-commands"></a> commands</h2>

<h3>adding your own commands</h3>

<p>To add a command, say <code>foo</code>, do this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>add this line in the rc file, within the <code>$RC</code> block, if it's not already
present:</p>

<pre><code>LOCAL_CODE =&gt; "$ENV{HOME}/local",
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>copy the program <code>foo</code> into <code>$HOME/local/commands</code>.  (Don't forget the
<code>chmod +x</code>!)</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>making commands available to remote users</h3>

<p>Once you do the above, <code>foo</code> is available as <code>gitolite foo</code>.  To make it
available to remote users (as <code>ssh git@host foo</code>), add the line:</p>

<pre><code>`foo`,
</code></pre>

<p>(including the comma at the end) to the ENABLE list in the rc file.</p>

<h2><a name="cb-hooks"></a> hooks</h2>

<p>The main documentation for this feature starts <a href="cust.html#hooks">here</a>.</p>

<h3>adding your own update hooks</h3>

<p>You have some update hooks (for example crlf checking) that you want to
include in gitolite.  Assuming the hook itself is tested and works as a normal
<strong>git</strong> update hook does (i.e., conforms to what <code>man githooks</code> says an update
hook should do), here's how to do this.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>add this line in the rc file, within the <code>$RC</code> block, if it's not already
present:</p>

<pre><code>LOCAL_CODE =&gt; "$ENV{HOME}/local",
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>copy your update hook to a subdirectory called VREF under this directory,
giving it a suitable name (let's say "crlf"):</p>

<pre><code># log on to server
cd $HOME
mkdir -p local/VREF
cp your-crlf-update-hook local/VREF/crlf
chmod +x local/VREF/crlf
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>in your gitolite-admin clone, edit conf/gitolite.conf and
add lines like this:</p>

<pre><code>    -   VREF/crlf       =   @all
</code></pre>

<p>to each repo that should have that "update" hook.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can simply add this at the end of the
gitolite.conf file:</p>

<pre><code>repo @all
    -   VREF/crlf       =   @all
</code></pre>

<p>Either way, add/commit/push the change to the gitolite-admin repo.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>adding other (non-update) hooks</h3>

<p>Say you want other hooks, like a post-receive hook.  Here's how:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>add this line in the rc file, within the <code>$RC</code> block, if it's not already
present:</p>

<pre><code>LOCAL_CODE =&gt; "$ENV{HOME}/local",
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>put your hooks into that directory, in a sub-sub-directory called
"hooks/common":</p>

<pre><code># log on to server
cd $HOME
mkdir -p local/hooks/common
cp your-post-receive-hook local/hooks/common/post-receive
chmod +x local/hooks/common/post-receive
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>run <code>gitolite setup</code> to have the hooks propagate to existing repos (repos
created after this will get them anyway).</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>variation: custom hooks only for some repos</h3>

<p>If the hook is an update hook, you implement it as a VREF, and simply change
<code>repo @all</code> in step 3 in the update hook section above to <code>repo @repolist</code> or
whatever.</p>

<p>For the other hooks this is not possible.  You have to either install the
hooks <em>manually</em> on the repos you want them on, or -- better still -- you do
something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>in the conf file, add a groupname for the set of repos you want:</p>

<pre><code>@foo = list of repos
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>write your hook code with this at the top:</p>

<pre><code># check if @foo is in the list of groups of which $GL_REPO is a member
gitolite list-memberships -r $GL_REPO | grep -x @foo &gt;/dev/null || exit 0
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>now add your hook as described in earlier steps</p></li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="cb-vrefs"></a> VREFs</h2>

<h3>adding your own VREFs</h3>

<p>Adding VREFs is the same as adding the update hook, so please see the section
on "adding your own update hooks" above.</p>

<h3>example VREFs</h3>

<p>However, <em>writing</em> a proper VREF is not the same as writing a normal git
"update hook".  A proper VREF does more than just take 3 arguments, do
something, and exit with a non-zero exit code for failure.</p>

<p>A VREF is called with at least 4 more arguments after the 3 that git itself
defines for an update hook, plus usually at least one or two more.  It also
returns a lot more meaningful results via STDOUT.</p>

<p>Here are some examples.  I also advise you to keep a browser tab open to the
doc on <a href="vref.html#vref-args">VREF arguments</a> as you look at these.</p>

<h4>example 1: restricting by day of week</h4>

<p>Here's the conf extract to say "junior devs can only push on weekdays":</p>

<pre><code>repo foo
    -   VREF/DAY/Sat    =   @junior-devs
    -   VREF/DAY/Sun    =   @junior-devs
</code></pre>

<p>The code for this VREF is ridiculously simple:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
echo VREF/DAY/`date +%a`
</code></pre>

<p>On encountering the VREF rules (i.e., when a junior dev tries to access this
repo), gitolite calls the "DAY" VREF-maker.  The code within the VREF maker
simply echoes something like "VREF/DAY/Mon", where the last part is whatever
the actual day of the week happens to be.</p>

<p>This output is then treated as a virtual ref and matched against the rules.
On a Monday to Friday, nothing happens, because the VREFs generated do not
match any deny rules (or indeed any rules at all).  On weekends, they do
match, and the access is denied.</p>

<h4>example 2: restricting by source IP address</h4>

<p>This one restricts junior developers to access this repo only from a specific
network block.  The conf file here is slightly different.  We know that the
VREF-maker will return with <em>some</em> network address (as you'll see in the code
later), so we set it up so that the correct network block is allowed and
anything else is disallowed:</p>

<pre><code>repo foo
    RW+ VREF/FROM/192.168.48.0/23   =   @junior-devs
    -   VREF/FROM                   =   @junior-devs
</code></pre>

<p>The code is not that complex.  We take the user's actual IP address (this is
available as the first word in <code>$SSH_CONNECTION</code> for ssh users, and for
smart-http users, gitolite fakes it and creates that variable!).  We then
treat the "23" in the VREF rule, which appears to the code as <code>$9</code>, as the
number of bits in the network address, then compute the network address for
the users IP with that number of bits.</p>

<p>This network address is then sent back.  (The <code>$9</code> is added back at the end,
but this is only to enable it to match the VREF rule).</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

# exit if no arguments were supplied to the VREF.  This covers the
# second VREF rule in the conf above
[ -n "$8" ] || exit 0

from=${SSH_CONNECTION%% *}

eval `ipcalc -n $from/$9`       # sets env var "NETWORK"

echo VREF/FROM/$NETWORK/$9
</code></pre>

<p>For a source IP of 192.168.49.97, this runs <code>ipcalc -n 192.168.49.97/23</code>,
which gives the network address 192.168.48.0.  The echo then just sends back
VREF/FROM/192.168.48.0/23.  This VREF matches the RW+ line.</p>

<p>But if the IP is, say, 192.168.45.67, running <code>ipcalc -n 192.168.45.67/23</code>
gives you 192.168.44.0.  The echo then send back VREF/FROM/192.18.44.0/23,
which won't match the RW+ line, but will match the next one (remember the
rules for <a href="refex.html">refex</a> matching?) and thus deny access.</p>

<p>(One thing that may not be obvious in this specific example is that you have
to be careful when constructing the VREF rule.  For any VREF/FROM/A/B, the
result of running <code>ipcalc -n A/B</code> must be A, otherwise this won't work.  That
is, the bits of the network address after the network bits must be zero).</p>

<h2><a name="cb-move"></a> moving stuff around</h2>

<h3>moving a gitolite install from one machine to another</h3>

<p>Assuming you're not making a version change, this is what you need to do:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>clone the latest gitolite-admin repo to your workstation</p></li>
<li><p>install gitolite normally on the new machine, using the same public key
<em>and</em> name for the admin as on the old machine when running the <code>gitolite
setup -pk</code> command.</p></li>
<li><p>copy over your <code>~/.gitolite.rc</code> file from the old machine to the new</p></li>
<li><p>run <code>gitolite setup</code> (on the server)</p></li>
<li><p>go to the gitolite-admin clone you made in step 1, add or change the
remote to point to the new machine, and <code>git push -f</code></p></li>
</ul>
