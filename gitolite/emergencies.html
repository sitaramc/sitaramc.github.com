<h2>install/setup issues</h2>

<p>Most install/setup issues are caused by lack of ssh knowledge.  Ssh is a
complex beast, and -- unless you are using the <a href="http.html">http</a> mode -- can cause
problems for people who are not familiar with its quirks.</p>

<p><strong>Be prepared to spend some time reading the <a href="ssh.html">ssh</a> documentation that comes
with gitolite</strong>.</p>

<h2><a name="lost-key"></a> lost admin key/access</h2>

<p>If you lost your gitolite <strong>admin</strong> key or access, here's what you do.  We'll
assume your username is 'alice'.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Make yourself a new keypair and copy the public key to the server as
'alice.pub'.</p></li>
<li><p>Log on to the server, and run <code>gitolite setup -pk alice.pub</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That's it; the new alice.pub file replaces whatever existed in the repo
before.</p>

<h2><a name="bypass"></a> bypassing gitolite</h2>

<p>You may have lost access because of a conf file error, in which case the above
trick won't help.  What you want is to make changes to the repo (or perhaps
just rewind) and push that.  Here's how to do that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Log on to the server.</p></li>
<li><p>Clone the admin repo using the full path: <code>git clone
$HOME/repositories/gitolite-admin.git temp</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Make whatever changes you want -- add/replace a key, 'git revert' or 'git
reset --hard' to an older commit, etc.  Anything you need to fix the
problem, really.</p></li>
<li><p>Run <code>gitolite push</code> (or possibly <code>gitolite push -f</code>).  Note that's
'gitolite push', not 'git push'.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><font color="red">
<strong>NOTE</strong>: gitolite does <strong>no access checking</strong> when you do this!
</font></p>

<h2><a name="botch"></a> botched something?</h2>

<h3>fixing botched repos</h3>

<p>If you copied some repos from somewhere else, or mucked with the hooks for
some reason, or deleted any gitolite-specific files, or tried any other
"behind the scenes" stunts, the quickest, sanest, way to fix everything up is:</p>

<ul>
<li>make sure any new repos you copied in are mentioned in the gitolite.conf
in some 'repo' line and the change pushed
</li>
<li>then run <code>gitolite setup</code> on the server
</li>
</ul>

<p>If the repo you botched is a wild repo, please ask on the mailing list or on
IRC (see <a href="index.html#contact">contact</a>).</p>

<h3><a name="clean"></a> cleaning out a botched install</h3>

<p>If you've read the <a href="files.html">files involved in gitolite</a> page, you probably know
the answer, but here's a list of files and directories to deal with:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Gitolite sources</strong> -- can be found by running <code>which gitolite</code>.  If it's
a symlink, go to its target directory.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gitolite admin directory</strong> -- <code>$HOME/.gitolite</code>.  Save the 'logs'
directory if you want to preserve them for any reason.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The rc file</strong> -- <code>$HOME/.gitolite.rc</code>.  If you made any changes to it
you can save it as some other name instead of deleting it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The gitolite-admin repo</strong> -- <code>$HOME/repositories/gitolite-admin.git</code>.
You can clone it somewhere to save it before blowing it away if you wish.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Git repositories</strong> -- <code>$HOME/repositories</code>.  The install process will
not touch any existing repos except 'gitolite-admin.git', so you do not
have to blow away (or move) your work repos to fix a botched install.</p>

<p>Only when you update the conf to include those repos and push the changes
will those repos be touched.  And even then all that happens is that the
update hook, if any, is replaced with gitolite's own hook.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ssh stuff</strong> -- exercise caution when doing this, but in general it
should be safe to delete all lines between the "gitolite start" and
"gitolite end" markers in <code>$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>.</p>

<p>Gitolite does not touch any other files in the ssh directory.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="ce"></a> common errors</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><code>WARNING: keydir/&lt;yourname&gt;.pub duplicates a non-gitolite key, sshd will ignore it</code></p>

<p>You used a key that is already set to give you shell access.  You cannot
use the same key to get shell access as well as access gitolite repos.</p>

<p>Solution: use a different keypair for gitolite.  There's a slightly longer
discussion in the <a href="setup.html">setup</a> page.  Also see <a href="sts.html#ybpfail">why bypassing causes a
problem</a> and both the documents in <a href="ssh.html">ssh</a> for background.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Empty compile time value given to use lib at hooks/update line 6</code></p>

<p>(followed by <code>Can't locate Gitolite/Hooks/Update.pm in @INC</code> a couple of
lines later).</p>

<p>You're bypassing gitolite.  You cloned the repo using the full path (i.e.,
including the <code>repositories/</code> prefix), either directly on the server, or
via ssh but with a key that gives you <strong>shell</strong> access.</p>

<p>Solution: same as for the previous bullet.</p>

<p>NOTE: If you really <em>must</em> do it, and this is a one-time thing, you can
try <code>gitolite push</code> instead of <code>git push</code>.  <strong>BUT</strong>... this defeats all
gitolite access control, so if you're going to do this often, maybe you
don't need gitolite!</p></li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="ue"></a> uncommon errors</h2>

<p>(This page intentionally left blank)</p>

<h2><a name="nonstd"></a> non-standard configs that'll trip you up</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>if your 'git' binary is in a non-PATH location, or you have more than one
version and want a specific one to be picked up, you will have to add a
line like this at the end of the rc file (outside the <code>%RC</code> hash, but
before the<code>1;</code> line):</p>

<pre><code>$ENV{PATH} = "/your/git/path:$ENV{PATH}";
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>having sshd setup to put the authorized_keys file somewhere other than
the default (which is in .ssh in the <a href="install.html#nnc">hosting user</a>'s home directory).</p></li>
<li><p>having sshd setup to not allow incoming ssh for the hosting user.  Check
things like 'Allowusers' setting in /etc/ssh/sshd_config etc.</p></li>
<li><p>having the home directory in a partition that is mounted noexec.</p></li>
<li><p>having the default shell be something like /bin/false, and/or not having
the default shell be part of /etc/shells.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="ngp"></a> things that are not gitolite problems</h2>

<p>There are several things that appear to be gitolite problems but are not.  I
cannot help with most of these (although the good folks on irc or the mailing
list -- see <a href="index.html#contact">contact</a> -- might be able to; they certainly appear to have a
lot more patience than I do, bless 'em!)</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Client side software</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>putty/plink
</li>
<li>jgit/Eclipse
</li>
<li>Mac OS client <strong>or</strong> server
</li>
<li>putty/plink
</li>
<li>windows as a server
</li>
<li>...probably some more I forgot; will update this list as I remember...
</li>
<li>did I mention putty/plink?
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Ssh</strong></p>

<p>The <em>superstar</em> of the "not a gitolite problem" category is actually ssh.</p>

<p>Surprised?  It is so common that it has <a href="auth.html">its own document</a> to tell
you why it is <em>not</em> a gitolite problem, while <a href="ssh.html">another one</a> tries to
help you anyway!</p>

<p>Everything I know is in that latter link.  Please email me about ssh ONLY
if you find something wrong or missing in those documents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Git</strong></p>

<p>I wish I had a dollar for each time someone did a <em>first push</em> on a new
repo, got an error because there were "no refs in common (etc.)", and
asked me why gitolite was not allowing the push.</p>

<p>Gitolite is designed to look like just another bare repo server to a
client (except requiring public keys -- no passwords allowed).  It is
<em>completely transparent</em> when there is no authorisation failure (i.e.,
when the access is allowed, the remote client has no way of knowing
gitolite was even installed!)</p>

<p>Even "on disk", apart from reserving the <code>update</code> hook for itself,
gitolite does nothing to your bare repos unless you tell it to (for
example, adding 'gitweb.owner' and such to the config file).</p>

<p>BEFORE you think gitolite is the problem, try the same thing with a normal
bare repo.  In most cases you can play with it just by doing something
like this:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir /tmp/throwaway
cd    /tmp/throwaway
git clone --mirror &lt;some repo you have a URL for&gt; bare.git
git clone bare.git worktree
cd worktree
&lt;...try stuff&gt;
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
