<h1>virtual refs</h1>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: fallthru is success in VREFs, unlike the normal refs.  That
won't make sense until you read further, but I had to put it up here for folks
who stop reading halfway!</p>

<p>Here's an example to start you off.</p>

<pre><code>repo    r1
    RW+                         =   lead_dev dev2 dev3
    -   VREF/COUNT/9            =   dev2 dev3
    -   VREF/COUNT/3/NEWFILES   =   dev2 dev3
</code></pre>

<p>Now dev2 and dev3 cannot push changes that affect more than 9 files at a time,
nor those that have more than 3 new files.</p>

<h2>rule matching recap</h2>

<p>You won't get any joy out of this if you don't understand at least
<a href="refex.html">refex</a>es and how <a href="rules.html">rules</a> are processed.</p>

<p>But VREFs have one <strong>very important difference</strong> from normal rules.  With
VREFs, a <strong>fallthru results in success</strong>.  You'll see why this is more
convenient as you read on.</p>

<h2>what is a virtual ref</h2>

<p>Here's how to think about this whole vref thing.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When git calls the update hook, it passes it the name of a ref, say
refs/heads/master or refs/tags/v1.0.  Let's call this a <strong>real ref</strong>.</p>

<p>This ref must pass the gauntlet of the <a href="rules.html">rules</a> as usual, and may be
allowed or rejected, as the case may be.  If it is rejected, that's the
end of the story.  None of the VREF code will run.</p>

<p>Anyway, this "real" ref is an <em>attribute</em> of the push.  We're using this
attribute to decide if the push should be allowed or not.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, there could be other attributes that a push has.  They could be
deduced from the pushed commits:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <em>name</em> of each file changed</li>
<li>the <em>number</em> of new or changed files</li>
<li>the <em>number</em> of new <em>binary</em> files</li>
</ul>

<p>or come from the environment:</p>

<ul>
<li>the time of day when the push is being made, vis-a-vis the IP address
it is coming from or the user it is coming from</li>
</ul>

<p>or simply come out of the blue:</p>

<ul>
<li>the phase of the moon!</li>
</ul>

<p><p>We'll call these properties <strong>virtual</strong> refs.</p></li>
<li><p>What do they look like?  Well, you already saw a couple up top.  The NAME
vref is more commonly used though.  So if this push changed files foo and
bar/baz, the NAME vrefs would be <code>VREF/NAME/foo</code> and <code>VREF/NAME/bar/baz</code>.</p></li>
</ul></p>

<h2><a name="vref-fallthru"></a> why is fallthru considered success with VREFs</h2>

<p>Virtual refs are <strong>best used</strong> [1] as additional "deny" rules, performing
extra checks that core gitolite cannot.  You usually want such extra checks
only for some people.</p>

<p>When fallthru is success, you can simply <em>ignore</em> all the other users (for
whom such additional checks are not needed).</p>

<p>If fallthru were to be considered 'failure', you'd be forced to add a "success
rule" like this for <em>every</em> vref you used in this repo, in each case listing
every user who was not already mentioned in the context of that vref:</p>

<pre><code>RW+ VREF/VREFNAME   =   @userlist   # uggh! what a pain!
</code></pre>

<p>Worse, since every virtual ref involves calling an external program, many of
these calls may be wasted.</p>

<p>[1] "best used as..." does not mean "only used as...".  For example it's
perfectly easy to turn this around if, instead of having a list of people who
<em>do</em> need extra checks, all you have is the complementary list:</p>

<pre><code>RW+ VREF/NAME/Makefile      =   @senior-devs
-   VREF/NAME/Makefile      =   @all
</code></pre>

<h2>how does it work</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>something creates a bunch of virtual refs</p></li>
<li><p>each generated vref goes through the gauntlet of the <a href="rules.html">rules</a>, just like
the real ref does, with the same logic except for the fact that fallthru
is success here.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>how are vrefs "created"</h3>

<p>As we know, the one and only real ref is sent in by git, so where do the
virtual ones come from?</p>

<p>Well, here's where you need to pay attention.  The same rule that the vref
needs to be checked against, like:</p>

<pre><code>-   VREF/COUNT/9            =   dev2 dev3
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>-   VREF/NAME/Makefile       =   @junior-devs
</code></pre>

<p>also <em>creates</em> them!  Yes.  Mind blowingly simple.  <code>\o/</code></p>

<p>Here's how:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For every refex starting with <code>VREF/FOO/</code> in a rule that applies to this
user, a call to a program called FOO is triggered.  (See <a href="cust.html">here</a> for
actual locations on disk).  Note that the program isn't even called if the
VREF rule doesn't apply to that user.</p></li>
<li><p>This call has several arguments.  For example, a line like:</p>

<pre><code>   -   VREF/COUNT/3/NEWFILES    =   user
</code></pre>

<p>sends <strong>nine arguments</strong>; see later for details.</p></li>
<li><p>The script can print anything it wants to STDOUT.  Lines not starting with
<code>VREF/</code> are printed as is (so your VREF can do mostly-normal printing to
STDOUT).</p>

<p>For lines starting with <code>VREF/</code>, the first word in each such line will be
treated as a virtual ref, while the rest, if any, is a message to be added
to the standard "...DENIED..." message that gitolite will print if that
refex matches and the rule is a deny rule.</p>

<p>Usually it only makes sense to either</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Print nothing that starts with <code>VREF/</code> -- if you don't want the rule
that triggered it to match (ie., whatever condition being tested was
not violated; like if the count of changed files did not exceed 9, in
our earlier example).</p></li>
<li><p>Print the refex itself (plus an optional message), so that it matches
the line which invoked it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>in what order are these programs called</h3>

<p>Vref generating programs (as they properly should be called) are called in the
sequence in which they appear in the conf file.</p>

<p>There are some optimisations to prevent calling the same VREF with the same
arguments more than once, and the NAME generating code is called only once
regardless of how many times it appears but these details should not concern
anyone but a developer.</p>

<h3><a name="vref-args"></a> arguments passed to the vref code</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Arguments <strong>1, 2, 3</strong>: the 'ref', 'oldsha', and 'newsha' that git passed
to the update hook (see 'man githooks').</p>

<p>This, combined with the fact that non-zero exits are detected, mean that
you can simply use an existing update.secondary as a new VREF as-is, no
changes needed.</p></li>
<li><p>Arguments <strong>4 and 5</strong>: the 'oldtree' and 'newtree' SHAs.  These are the
same as the oldsha and newsha values, except if one of them is all-0.
(indicating a ref creation or deletion).  In that case the corresponding
'tree' SHA is set (by gitolite, as a courtesy) to the special SHA
<code>4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904</code>, which is the hash of an empty
tree.</p>

<p>(None of these shenanigans would have been needed if <code>git diff $oldsha
$newsha</code> would not error out when passed an all-0 SHA.)</p></li>
<li><p>Argument <strong>6</strong>: the attempted access flag.  Typically <code>W</code> or <code>+</code>, but
could also be <code>C</code>, <code>D</code>, or any of these 4 followed by <code>M</code>.  If you have to
ask what they mean, you haven't read enough gitolite documentation to be
able to make virtual refs work.</p></li>
<li><p>Argument <strong>7</strong>: is the entire refex; say <code>VREF/COUNT/3/NEWFILES</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Arguments <strong>8 onward</strong>: are the split out (by <code>/</code>) portions of the refex,
excluding the first two components.  In our example they would be <code>3</code>
followed by <code>NEWFILES</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, argument 7 is redundant if you have 8 and 9.  It's meant to make it easy
to write vref scripts in any language.  See script examples in source.</p>

<h3>what (else) can the vref code pass back</h3>

<p>Actually, the vref code can pass anything back; each line in its output that
starts with <code>VREF/</code> will be matched against all the rules as usual (with the
exception that fallthru is not failure).</p>

<p>For example, you could have a ruleset like this:</p>

<pre><code>repo r1
    # ... normal rules ...

    -   VREF/TIME/WEEKEND       =   @interns
    -   VREF/TIME/WEEKNIGHT     =   @interns
    -   VREF/TIME/HOLIDAY       =   @interns
</code></pre>

<p>and you could write the TIME vref code to passback any or all
of the times that match.  Then if an intern tried to access the system, each
rule would trigger a call to gl-bindir/VREF/TIME.</p>

<p>The script should send back any of the applicable times (even more than one,
or none at all, as the case may be).  So even if it was invoked using the
first rule, it might pass back (to gitolite) a virtual ref saying
'VREF/TIME/HOLIDAY', which would promptly cause the request to be denied.</p>

<h2>VREFs shipped with gitolite</h2>

<h3><a name="NAME"></a> restricting pushes by dir/file name</h3>

<p>The "NAME" VREF allows you to restrict pushes by the names of dirs and files
changed.  (Side note: the NAME VREF is the only one directly implemented
within the update hook, so you won't find it in the VREF directory).</p>

<p>Here's an example.  Say you don't want junior developers pushing changes to
the Makefile, because it's quite complex:</p>

<pre><code>repo foo
        RW+                             =   @senior_devs
        RW                              =   @junior_devs

        -   VREF/NAME/Makefile          =   @junior_devs
</code></pre>

<p>When a senior dev pushes, the VREF is not invoked at all.  But when a junior
dev pushes, the VREF is invoked, and it returns a list of files changed <strong>as
refs</strong>, looking like this:</p>

<pre><code>VREF/NAME/file-1
VREF/NAME/dir-2/file-3
...etc...
</code></pre>

<p>Each of these refs is matched against the access rules.  If one of them
happens to be the Makefile, then the ref returned (VREF/NAME/Makefile) will
match the deny rule and kill the push.</p>

<p>Another way to use this is when you know what is allowed instead of what is
not allowed.  Let's say the QA person is only allowed to touch a file called
CHANGELOG and any files in a directory called ReleaseNotes:</p>

<pre><code>repo foo
        RW+                             =   @senior_devs
        RW                              =   @junior_devs
        RW+                             =   QA-guy

        RW+ VREF/NAME/CHANGELOG         =   QA-guy
        RW+ VREF/NAME/ReleaseNotes/     =   QA-guy
        -   VREF/NAME/                  =   QA-guy
</code></pre>

<h3>number of new files</h3>

<p>The COUNT VREF is used like this:</p>

<pre><code>-   VREF/COUNT/9                    =   @junior-developers
</code></pre>

<p>In response, if anyone in the user list pushes a commit series that
changes more than 9 files, a vref of "VREF/COUNT/9" is returned.  Gitolite
uses that as a "ref" to match against all the rules, hits the same rule
that invoked it, and denies the request.</p>

<p>If the user did not push more than 9 files, the VREF code returns nothing,
and nothing happens.</p>

<p>COUNT can take one more argument:</p>

<pre><code>-   VREF/COUNT/9/NEWFILES           =   @junior-developers
</code></pre>

<p>This is the same as before, but have to be more than 9 <em>new</em> files not
just changed files.</p>

<h3>advanced filetype detection</h3>

<p>Note: this is more for illustration than use; it's rather specific to one of
the projects I manage but the idea is the important thing.</p>

<p>Sometimes a file has a standard extension (that cannot be 'gitignore'd), but
it is actually automatically generated.  Here's one way to catch it:</p>

<pre><code> -   VREF/FILETYPE/AUTOGENERATED     =   @all
</code></pre>

<p>You can look at <code>src/VREF/FILETYPE</code> to see how it handles the
'AUTOGENERATED' option.  You could also have a more generic option, like
perhaps BINARY, and handle that in the FILETYPE vref too.</p>

<h3>checking author email</h3>

<p>Some people want to ensure that "you can only push your own commits".</p>

<p>If you force it on everyone, this is a very silly idea (see "Philosophical
Notes" section of <code>src/VREF/EMAIL-CHECK</code>).</p>

<p>But there may be value in enforcing it just for the junior developers.</p>

<p>The neat thing is that the existing <code>contrib/update.email-check</code> was just
copied to <code>src/VREF/EMAIL-CHECK</code> and it works, because VREFs get
the same first 3 arguments and those are all that it cares about.  (Note: you
have to change one subroutine in that script if you want to use it)</p>

<h3><a name="votes"></a> voting on commits</h3>

<p>Although gitolite can't/won't do the whole "code review + workflow
enforcement" thing that Gerrit Code Review does, a basic implementation of
voting on a commit is surprisingly easy.  See src/VREF/VOTES for details (and
note that the actual <em>code</em> is just 2-3 lines; the rest is inline
documentation).</p>

<h2>other ideas -- code welcome!</h2>

<h3>"no non-merge first-parents"</h3>

<p>Shruggar on #gitolite wanted this.  Possible code to implement it would be
something like this (untested)</p>

<pre><code>[ -z "$(git rev-list --first-parent --no-merges $2..$3)" ]
</code></pre>

<p>This can be implemented using <code>src/VREF/MERGE-CHECK</code> as a model.  That script
does what the 'M' qualifier does in access rules (see last part of
<a href="write-types.html">this</a>), although the syntax to be used in conf/gitolite will be
quite different.</p>

<h3>other ideas for VREFs</h3>

<p>Here are some more ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Number of commits (<code>git rev-list --count $old $new</code>).</li>
<li>Number of binary files in commit (currently I only know to count
occurrences of <code>Bin</code> in the output of <code>git diff --stat</code>.</li>
<li>Number of <em>new</em> binary files (count <code>Bin 0 -&gt;</code> in <code>git diff --stat</code>
output).</li>
<li>Time of day/day of week (see example snippet somewhere above).</li>
<li>IP address.</li>
<li>Phase of the moon.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that pretty much anything that involves <code>$oldsha..$newsha</code> will have to
deal with the issue that when you push a new tag or branch, the "old" part
is all 0's, and unless you consider <code>--all</code> existing branches and tags it
becomes meaningless in terms of "number of new files" etc.</p>
