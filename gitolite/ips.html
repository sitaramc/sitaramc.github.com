<h1>idiot-proof setup for gitolite</h1>

<p>If I gave you this link to read, it most likely means either:</p>

<ul>
<li>(most common reason) you got really confused by <a href="ssh.html">ssh</a>
</li>
<li>(a bit less common) you got confused by how to administer users and repos
using gitolite
</li>
</ul>

<p>Don't take the title personally.  The "idiot" in the title is indeed a real
person who once bugged me so much I wrote this for him.  However, I have since
realised that this is also useful for (a) people for whom English is not the
first language and (b) people who really should not be doing technical work at
this level, but are forced to do it by circumstances.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="ips.html">idiot-proof setup for gitolite</a>
<ul>
<li>pre-requisites
</li>
<li>additional restrictions that seem unnecessary
</li>
<li>no support for this document
</li>
<li>assumptions
</li>
<li>installation tasks
</li>
<li>administration tasks
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>pre-requisites</h2>

<ul>
<li>any Linux machine on which git has already been installed
</li>
<li>probably any BSD or legacy system like Solaris will also work, but I have
not tested them
<ul>
<li>I do not consider Apple devices to be Unix enough; it should work, but
please do not ask me for help if it does not.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>additional restrictions that seem unnecessary</h2>

<p>People who <strong>do</strong> understand ssh will realise that this document contains many
extra restrictions and constraints that are not actually needed.  That's the
whole point -- I'm compensating for lack of ssh knowledge by removing things
that trip people up.</p>

<h2>no support for this document</h2>

<p>If even this document does not help you install gitolite, I probably cannot
help you.  Either you did not follow the instructions carefully <font
color="gray">(maybe some task has to be run on your workstation, but you ran
it on the server, or you ran something as root when it should be as the
hosting user, etc.)</font>, or your environment is far too different from
standard Unix, or you have some other problem.  In any case, it is not
something I can help with.  Sorry.</p>

<h2>assumptions</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>your name is Ron.  Substitute accordingly in the instructions below.</p></li>
<li><p>you have a workstation.</p></li>
<li><p>you have a server called <code>server</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>you have root access on this server.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>installation tasks</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Create a new userid on the server, say <code>git</code>.  This will be the <strong>hosting
user</strong>.  ("hosting user" means when you're done installing, your users
will use URLs like <code>git@server:reponame</code> or <code>ssh://git@server/reponame</code>).</p>

<p><strong>Make sure this is a NEW userid</strong>.</p>

<p>If the name you want already exists, then:</p>

<ul>
<li>log in as root
</li>
<li>if you have any data on that user's HOME directory save it somewhere
else
</li>
<li>delete the userid
</li>
<li>completely wipe out (erase) the home directory of the user (since on
most systems merely deleting the user does not remove the home
directory)
</li>
<li>re-create the userid again
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If you don't already have one, make yourself an ssh keypair <strong>on your
workstation</strong>.</p>

<p>Do NOT add this public key to the authorised keys file on the newly
created hosting user!</p>

<p>Your ONLY access to the new (<code>git</code>) userid should be by logging onto the
server as root, then running <code>su - git</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Now copy the pubkey from your workstation (<code>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code>) to the
server as <code>/tmp/ron.pub</code>.  (Your name is Ron, remember?)</p></li>
<li><p>Log on to the server as root.</p></li>
<li><p>Switch to the <code>git</code> user:</p>

<pre><code>su - git
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Clone the gitolite source code</p>

<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Install it</p>

<pre><code>cd $HOME
mkdir -p bin
gitolite/install -to $HOME/bin
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Set it up</p>

<pre><code>cd $HOME
$HOME/bin/gitolite setup -pk /tmp/ron.pub
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Now go to your workstation and type in</p>

<pre><code>git ls-remote git@server:gitolite-admin
</code></pre>

<p>This should return something like</p>

<pre><code>9dd8aab60bac5e54ccf887a87b4f3d35c96b05e4    HEAD
9dd8aab60bac5e54ccf887a87b4f3d35c96b05e4    refs/heads/master
</code></pre>

<p>(do I have to mention that your SHAs will be different?)</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>administration tasks</h2>

<p>Most day-to-day administration is done by making changes to a clone of the
gitolite-admin repo and pushing.  (There are some things that are done by
editing <code>$HOME/.gitolite.rc</code> on the server, but those are too advanced for
this tutorial so we will ignore that).</p>

<ol>
<li><p>To start administering gitolite, clone the gitolite-admin repo:</p>

<pre><code>git clone git@server:gitolite-admin
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Now go to the new directory this creates, and look around:</p>

<pre><code>cd gitolite-admin
ls -A
</code></pre>

<p>which gives you</p>

<pre><code>conf/  .git/  keydir/
</code></pre>

<p>Ignoring the ".git" and exploring further:</p>

<pre><code>ls -A conf keydir
</code></pre>

<p>which says:</p>

<pre><code>conf:
gitolite.conf


keydir:
ron.pub
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Let's say you want to add your colleague Alice.  She has sent you her ssh
public key by email (the file is called <code>id_rsa.pub</code>).  Save this file as
/tmp/alice.pub, then do this:</p>

<pre><code># still in your gitolite-admin clone, from the previous step
cp /tmp/alice.pub keydir
git add keydir
git commit -m 'new user alice'
git push
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Well, that might not be sufficient.  There aren't any new repos for alice
to play with, yet.  So here's what you do: edit "conf/gitolite.conf" and
add something like to the end:</p>

<pre><code>repo foo
    RW+     =   alice
    R       =   ron
</code></pre>

<p>Save the file, then <code>git add conf; git commit -m 'new repo foo'; git
push</code>.</p>

<p>This will automatically the brand new repo called "foo" on the server, and
alice will be able to clone from it, or push anything to it.</p></li>
</ol>
