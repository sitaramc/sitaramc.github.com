<h2><a name="nnc"></a> notes and naming conventions</h2>

<p>Gitolite uses a single "real" (i.e., unix) user to provide secure access to
git repos to any number of "virtual" users, without giving them a shell.</p>

<p>The real user used is called the <strong>hosting user</strong>.  Typically this user is
<em>git</em>, and that is what we will use throughout the documentation.  However
RPMs and DEBs create a user called <em>gitolite</em> for this, so adjust instructions
and examples accordingly.</p>

<p><strong>Unless otherwise stated, everything in this page is to be done by logging in
as this "hosting user"</strong>.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Any unix user can be a hosting user.
</li>
<li>Which also means you can have several hosting users on the same machine.
</li>
<li>The URLs used will be of the form <code>git@host:reponame</code> (or its longer
equivalent starting with <code>ssh://</code>).  The <code>.git</code> at the end is optional.  I
recommend you leave it out, so your reponames are consistent with what the
conf file uses.
</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="req"></a> requirements</h2>

<h3>your skills</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>If you're installing gitolite, you're a "system admin", like it or not.
Since most people use the ssh mode, <strong><a href="ssh.html">ssh</a></strong> is therefore a necessary
skill.  Please take the time to learn at least enough to get passwordless
access working.</p></li>
<li><p>You also need to be somewhat familiar with git itself.  You cannot
administer a whole bunch of git repositories if you don't know the basics
of git.</p></li>
<li><p>Some familiarity with Unix and shells is probably required.</p></li>
<li><p>Regular expressions are a big part of gitolite in many places but
familiarity is not necessary to do <em>basic</em> access control.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>server</h3>

<ul>
<li>Any Unix system with a posix compatible "sh" and a <strong>sane</strong> file system.
</li>
<li>Git version 1.6.6 or later.  (Git 1.7.8 or later if you want to run the
test suite).
</li>
<li>Perl 5.8.8 or later.
</li>
<li>Openssh (almost any version).  Optional if you're using <a href="http.html">smart
http</a>.
</li>
<li>A dedicated Unix userid to be the hosting user, usually "git" but it can
be any user, even your own normal one.  (If you're using an RPM/DEB the
install probably created one called "gitolite").
</li>
</ul>

<p>Also see the <a href="WARNINGS.html">WARNINGS</a> page for important information of general use.</p>

<h3>client</h3>

<ul>
<li>Openssh client.
</li>
<li>Git 1.6.6 or later.  Almost any git client will work, as long as it knows
how to use ssh keys and send the right one along.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>getting the software</h2>

<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite
</code></pre>

<p>(Do I need to mention that you can optionally check out a specific tag if you
wish, as long as it's not too old?)</p>

<h2>the actual install</h2>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: This section describes installing an ssh-based setup.  For smart
http setup click <a href="http.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Gitolite has only one server side "command" now, much like git itself.  This
command is <code>gitolite</code>.  You don't need to place it anywhere special; worst
case you run it with the full path.</p>

<p>"Installation" consists of the following options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Keep the sources anywhere and use the full path to run the <code>gitolite</code>
command.
</li>
<li>Keep the sources anywhere and symlink <em>just</em> the <code>gitolite</code> program to
some directory on your <code>$PATH</code>.
</li>
<li>Copy the sources somewhere and use that path to run the <code>gitolite</code>
command.
</li>
</ol>

<p>Option 2 is the best for general use.</p>

<p>There is a program called 'install' that helps you do these easily.  Assuming
your cloned the repo like this:</p>

<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite
</code></pre>

<p>you can run the 'install' command in 3 different ways:</p>

<pre><code># option 1
gitolite/install

# option 2
gitolite/install -ln
# defaults to $HOME/bin (which is assumed to exist)
#   ** or **
# or use a specific directory (please supply full path):
gitolite/install -ln /usr/local/bin

# option 3
# (again, please supply a full path)
gitolite/install -to /usr/local/gitolite/bin
</code></pre>

<p>Creating a symlink doesn't need a separate program but 'install' also runs
<code>git describe</code> to create a VERSION file, which, trust me, is important!</p>

<p><strong>Next step</strong>: run <a href="setup.html"><strong>setup</strong></a>.</p>

<h2>upgrading</h2>

<ul>
<li>Update your clone of the gitolite source.
</li>
<li>Repeat the install command you used earlier (make sure you use the same
arguments as before).
</li>
<li>Run <code>gitolite setup</code>.
</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="package"></a> packaging gitolite</h2>

<p>Gitolite has broad similarities to git in terms of packaging requirements.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Git has 150 executables to marshal and put somewhere.  Gitolite has the
directories <code>commands</code>, <code>lib</code>, <code>syntactic-sugar</code>, <code>triggers</code>, and <code>VREF</code>.</p>

<p>It doesn't matter what this directory is.  As an example, Fedora keeps
git's 150 executables in /usr/libexec/git-core, so /usr/libexec/gitolite
may be a good choice; it's upto you.</p>

<p><em>The rest of this section will assume you chose /usr/libexec/gitolite as
the location, and that this location contains the 5 directories named
above</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Git has the <code>GIT_EXEC_PATH</code> env var to point to this directory.  Gitolite
has <code>GL_BINDIR</code>.  However, in git, the "make" process embeds a suitable
default into the binary, making the env var optional.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>With that said, here's one way to package gitolite:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Put the executable <code>gitolite</code> somewhere in PATH.  Put the executable
<code>gitolite-shell</code> in /usr/libexec/gitolite (along with those 5 directories).</p>

<p>Change the 2 assignments to <code>$ENV{GL_BINDIR}</code>, one in 'gitolite', one in
'gitolite-shell', to "/usr/libexec/gitolite" from <code>$FindBin::RealBin</code>.
This is equivalent to "make" embedding the exec-path into the executable.</p>

<p><strong>OR</strong></p>

<p>Put both executables <code>gitolite</code> and <code>gitolite-shell</code> also into
/usr/libexec/gitolite (i.e., as siblings to the 5 directories mentioned
above).  Then <em>symlink</em> <code>/usr/libexec/gitolite/gitolite</code> to some directory
in the PATH.  Do not <em>copy</em> it; it must be a symlink.</p>

<p>Gitolite will find the exec-path by following the symlink.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>Gitolite</code> subdirectory in <code>/usr/libexec/gitolite/lib</code> can stay right
there, <strong>OR</strong>, if your distro policies don't allow that, can be put in any
directory in perl's <code>@INC</code> path (such as <code>/usr/share/perl5/vendor_perl</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, a file called <code>/usr/libexec/gitolite/VERSION</code> must contain a
suitable version string.</p></li>
</ul>
