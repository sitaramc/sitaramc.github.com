<h2>notes and naming conventions</h2>

<p>Gitolite uses a single "real" (i.e., unix) user to provide secure access to
git repos to any number of "virtual" users, without giving them a shell.</p>

<p>The real user used is called the <strong>hosting user</strong>.  Typically this user is
<em>git</em>, and that is what we will use throughout the documentation.  However
RPMs and DEBs create a user called <em>gitolite</em> for this, so adjust instructions
and examples accordingly.</p>

<p><strong>Unless otherwise stated, everything in this page is to be done by logging in
as this "hosting user"</strong>.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Any unix user can be a hosting user.</li>
<li>Which also means you can have several hosting users on the same machine.</li>
<li>The URLs used will be of the form <code>git@host:reponame</code> (or its longer
equivalent starting with <code>ssh://</code>).  The <code>.git</code> at the end is optional.  I
recommend you leave it out, so your reponames are consistent with what the
conf file uses.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="req"></a> requirements</h2>

<h3>your skills</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>If you're installing gitolite, you're a "system admin", like it or not.
Ssh is therefore a necessary skill.  Please take the time to learn at
least enough to get passwordless access working.</p></li>
<li><p>You also need to be somewhat familiar with git itself.  You cannot
administer a whole bunch of git repositories if you don't know the basics
of git.</p></li>
<li><p>Some familiarity with Unix and shells is probably required.</p></li>
<li><p>Regular expressions are a big part of gitolite in many places but
familiarity is not necessary to do <em>basic</em> access control.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>server</h3>

<ul>
<li>Any Unix system with a posix compatible "sh".</li>
<li>Git version 1.6.6 or later.</li>
<li>Perl 5.8.8 or later.</li>
<li>Openssh (almost any version).  Optional if you're using <a href="http.html">smart
http</a>.</li>
<li>A dedicated Unix userid to be the hosting user, usually "git" but it can
be any user, even your own normal one.  (If you're using an RPM/DEB the
install probably created one called "gitolite").</li>
</ul>

<p>Also see the <a href="WARNINGS.html">WARNINGS</a> page for more on what gitolite expects on the server
side.</p>

<h3>client</h3>

<ul>
<li>Openssh client.</li>
<li>Git 1.6.6 or later.  Almost any git client will work, as long as it knows
how to use ssh keys and send the right one along.</li>
</ul>

<h2>getting the software</h2>

<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite
</code></pre>

<h2>the actual install</h2>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: This section describes installing an ssh-based setup.  For smart
http setup click <a href="http.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Gitolite has only one server side "command" now, much like git itself.  This
command is <code>gitolite</code>.  You don't need to place it anywhere special; worst
case you run it with the full path.</p>

<p>"Installation" consists of the following options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Keep the sources anywhere and use the full path to run the <code>gitolite</code>
command.</li>
<li>Keep the sources anywhere and symlink <em>just</em> the <code>gitolite</code> program to
some directory on your <code>$PATH</code>.</li>
<li>Copy the sources somewhere and use that path to run the <code>gitolite</code>
command.</li>
</ol>

<p>Option 2 is the best for general use.</p>

<p>There is a program called 'install' that helps you do these easily.  Assuming
your cloned the repo like this:</p>

<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite
</code></pre>

<p>you can run the 'install' command in 3 different ways:</p>

<pre><code># option 1
gitolite/install

# option 2
gitolite/install -ln
# defaults to $HOME/bin (which is assumed to exist)
#   ** or **
# or use a specific directory (please supply full path):
gitolite/install -ln /usr/local/bin

# option 3
# (again, please supply a full path)
gitolite/install -to /usr/local/gitolite/bin
</code></pre>

<p>Creating a symlink doesn't need a separate program but 'install' also runs
<code>git describe</code> to create a VERSION file, which, trust me, is important!</p>

<p><strong>Next step</strong>: run <a href="setup.html"><strong>setup</strong></a>.</p>

<h2>upgrading</h2>

<ul>
<li>Update your clone of the gitolite source.</li>
<li>Repeat the install command you used earlier (make sure you use the same
arguments as before).</li>
<li>Run <code>gitolite setup</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="package"></a> packaging gitolite</h2>

<p>Gitolite has broad similarities to git in terms of packaging requirements.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Git has 150 executables to marshal and put somewhere.  Gitolite has the
directories <code>commands</code>, <code>lib</code>, <code>syntactic-sugar</code>, <code>triggers</code>, and <code>VREF</code>.</p>

<p>It doesn't matter what this directory is.  As an example, Fedora keeps
git's 150 executables in /usr/libexec/git-core, so /usr/libexec/gitolite
may be a good choice; it's upto you.</p>

<p><em>The rest of this section will assume you chose /usr/libexec/gitolite as
the location, and that this location contains the 5 directories named
above</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Git has the <code>GIT_EXEC_PATH</code> env var to point to this directory.  Gitolite
has <code>GL_BINDIR</code>.  However, in git, the "make" process embeds a suitable
default into the binary, making the env var optional.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>With that said, here's one way to package gitolite:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Put the executable <code>gitolite</code> somewhere in PATH.  Put the executable
<code>gitolite-shell</code> in /usr/libexec/gitolite (along with those 5 directories).</p>

<p>Change the 2 assignments to <code>$ENV{GL_BINDIR}</code>, one in 'gitolite', one in
'gitolite-shell', to "/usr/libexec/gitolite" from <code>$FindBin::RealBin</code>.
This is equivalent to "make" embedding the exec-path into the executable.</p>

<p><strong>OR</strong></p>

<p>Put both executables <code>gitolite</code> and <code>gitolite-shell</code> also into
/usr/libexec/gitolite (i.e., as siblings to the 5 directories mentioned
above).  Then <em>symlink</em> <code>/usr/libexec/gitolite/gitolite</code> to some directory
in the PATH.  Do not <em>copy</em> it; it must be a symlink.</p>

<p>Gitolite will find the exec-path by following the symlink.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>Gitolite</code> subdirectory in <code>/usr/libexec/gitolite/lib</code> can stay right
there, <strong>OR</strong>, if your distro policies don't allow that, can be put in any
directory in perl's <code>@INC</code> path (such as <code>/usr/share/perl5/vendor_perl</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, a file called <code>/usr/libexec/gitolite/VERSION</code> must contain a
suitable version string.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="migr"></a> migrating</h2>

<p><font color="gray">This section is about migrating from older gitolite to
"g3".  If you're migrating from gitosis, see <a href="gsmigr.html">here</a>.</font></p>

<p>First things first: g2 will be supported for a good long time for critical
bugs, although enhancements and new features won't happen.</p>

<p>If you're an existing (gitolite v1.x or v2.x) user, and wish to migrate , here
are the steps:</p>

<h3>pre-migration checks</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Check the <a href="dev-status.html">dev-status</a> page to make sure all the features you want have
been implemented in g3.</p></li>
<li><p>Read the <a href="g2migr.html">pre-migration</a> page to see what changes affect you and
your users, and how much time it might take you to migrate.  (The closer
you were to a default install of the old gitolite, the less time a
migration will take.)</p>

<p>This includes at least running <code>check-g2-compat</code> to see what are the big
issues you might need to address during the migration.</p>

<p>In particular, note if you use any variables that the pre-migration
checklist describes as "requires presetting".</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>the actual migration</h3>

<p>(Note: You may also like the <a href="g2migr-example.html">example migration</a> page).</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: nothing in any of the gitolite install/setup/etc will ever touch the
<em>data</em> in any repository except the gitolite-admin repo.  The only thing it
will normally touch in normal repos is the <code>update</code> hook.</p>

<p><strong>Note: all migration happens on the server; you do not need your
workstation</strong>.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Carefully wipe out the old gitolite:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>code</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Delete or move away all the old gitolite scripts.  Check the path
to the gl-auth-command in <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> if you forgot
where you put them.</p></li>
<li><p>Delete or move away the two directories named in the two variables
<code>GL_PACKAGE_CONF</code> and <code>GL_PACKAGE_HOOKS</code> in <code>~/.gitolite.rc</code>.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The <strong>rc file</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Rename <code>~/.gitolite.rc</code> to something else.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The <strong>admin repo</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>clone <code>~/repositories/gitolite-admin.git</code> to someplace safe</li>
<li>then delete <code>~/repositories/gitolite-admin.git</code></li>
</ul>

<p>(Make sure you do not delete any other repos!)</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>admin directory</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you need to preserve logs, move the ~/.gitolite/logs` directory
somewhere else.</p></li>
<li><p>If you added any custom hooks and wish to preserve them, move the
~/.gitolite/hooks` directory somewhere else.</p></li>
<li><p>Delete <code>~/.gitolite</code>.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Install gitolite g3; see <a href="install.html">install</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>If you're using any rc variables that the pre-migration checklist said
would "require presetting", then read about <a href="g2migr.html#rc-preset">presetting</a> the rc
file, and follow those instructions to create your new rc file.</p></li>
<li><p>Setup gitolite; see <a href="setup.html">setup</a>.  However, the 'setup' step need not supply
a private key.  You can run it as <code>gitolite setup -a admin</code>.</p>

<p>NOTE: ignore any 'split conf not set, gl-conf present...' errors at this
time.  You may see none, some, or many.  It does not matter right now.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure your gitolite-admin clone has the correct pubkey for the
administrator in its <code>keydir</code> directory, then run <a href="emergencies.html#bypass"><code>gitolite push
-f</code></a> to overwrite the "default" admin repo created by the install.</p></li>
<li><p>Handle any errors, look for migration issues, etc., as described in the
links at the top of this page.</p>

<p>This also includes building up your new <code>~/.gitolite.rc</code> file.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You're done.</p>
