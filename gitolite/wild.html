<h2>quick introduction</h2>

<p>The wildrepos feature allows you to specify access control rules using regular
expression patterns, so you can have many actual repos being served by a
single set of rules in the config file.  The regex pattern can also include
the word <code>CREATOR</code> in it, allowing you to parametrise the name of the user
creating the repo.</p>

<p>See the section on "repo patterns" later for additional information on what
counts as a "wild" repo pattern and how it is matched.</p>

<h2>(admin) declaring wild repos in the conf file</h2>

<p>Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>@prof       =   u1
@TAs        =   u2 u3
@students   =   u4 u5 u6

repo    assignments/CREATOR/a[0-9][0-9]
    C   =   @students
    RW+ =   CREATOR
    RW  =   WRITERS @TAs
    R   =   READERS @prof
</code></pre>

<p>Note the "C" permission.  This is a standalone "C", which gives the named
users the right to <em>create a repo</em>.  <font color="gray">This is not to be
confused with the "RWC" or its variants described elsewhere, which are about
<em>branches</em>, not <em>repos</em>.</font></p>

<h2><a name="create"></a> (user) creating a specific repo</h2>

<p>For now, ignore the special usernames READERS and WRITERS, and just create a
new repo, as user "u4" (a student):</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone git@server:assignments/u4/a12
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/sitaram/a12/.git/
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/git/repositories/assignments/u4/a12.git/
warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository.
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the <em>two</em> empty repo inits, and the order in which they occur ;-)</p>

<h2>a slightly different example</h2>

<p>Here's how the same example would look if you did not want the CREATOR's name
to be part of the actual repo name.</p>

<pre><code>repo    assignments/a[0-9][0-9]
    C   =   @students
    RW+ =   CREATOR
    RW  =   WRITERS @TAs
    R   =   READERS @prof
</code></pre>

<p>We haven't changed anything except the repo name pattern.  This means that the
first student that creates, say, <code>assignments/a12</code> becomes the owner.
Mistakes (such as claiming a12 instead of a13) need to be rectified by an
admin logging on to the back end, though it's not too difficult.</p>

<p>You could also repace the C line like this:</p>

<pre><code>    C   =   @TAs
</code></pre>

<p>and have a TA create the repos in advance.</p>

<h2>repo patterns</h2>

<h3>pattern versus normal repo</h3>

<p>Due to projects like <code>gtk+</code>, the <code>+</code> character is now considered a valid
character for an <em>ordinary</em> repo.  Therefore, a pattern like <code>foo/.+</code> does not
look like a regex to gitolite.  Use <code>foo/..*</code> if you want that.</p>

<p>Also, <code>..*</code> by itself is not considered a valid repo pattern.  Try
<code>[a-zA-Z0-9].*</code>.  <code>CREATOR/..*</code> will also work.</p>

<h3>line-anchored regexes</h3>

<p>A regex like</p>

<pre><code>repo assignments/S[0-9]+/A[0-9]+
</code></pre>

<p>would match <code>assignments/S02/A37</code>.  It will not match <code>assignments/S02/ABC</code>,
or <code>assignments/S02/a37</code>, obviously.</p>

<p>But you may be surprised to find that it does not match even
<code>assignments/S02/A37/B99</code>.  This is because internally, gitolite
<em>line-anchors</em> the given regex; so that regex actually becomes
<code>^assignments/S[0-9]+/A[0-9]+$</code> -- notice the line beginning and ending
metacharacters.</p>

<blockquote>
  <hr />
  
  <p><em>Side-note: contrast with refexes</em></p>
  
  <p>Just for interest, note that this is in contrast to the refexes for the
    normal "branch" permissions, as described in <code>doc/gitolite.conf.mkd</code> and
    elsewhere.  These "refexes" are only anchored at the start; a pattern like
    <code>refs/heads/master</code> actually can match <code>refs/heads/master01/bar</code> as well,
    even if no one will actually push such a branch!  You can anchor both
    sides if you really care, by using <code>master$</code> instead of <code>master</code>, but that
    is <em>not</em> the default for refexes.</p>
  
  <hr />
</blockquote>

<h2><a name="roles"></a> roles</h2>

<p>The tokens READERS and WRITERS are called "role" names.  The access rules in
the conf file decide what permissions these roles have, but they don't say
what users are in each of these roles.</p>

<p>That needs to be done by the creator of the repo, using the <code>perms</code> command.
You can run <code>ssh git@host perms -h</code> for detailed help, but in brief, that
command lets you give and take away roles to users.  <a href="user.html#perms">This</a> has some
more detail.</p>

<h3>adding other roles</h3>

<p>If you want to have more than just the 2 default roles, say something like:</p>

<pre><code>repo foo/..*
  C                 =   u1
  RW    refs/tags/  =   TESTERS
  -     refs/tags/  =   @all
  RW+               =   WRITERS
  RW                =   INTERNS
  R                 =   READERS
  RW+D              =   MANAGERS
</code></pre>

<p>You can add the new names to the ROLES hash in the <code>~/.gitolite.rc</code> file; see
comments in that file for how to do that.  Be sure to run the 2 commands
mentioned there after you have added the roles.</p>

<h4><a name="rolenamewarn"></a> <font color="red"><strong>IMPORTANT WARNING ABOUT THIS FEATURE</strong></font></h4>

<p>Please make sure that none of the role names conflict with any of the user
names or group names in the system.  For example, if you have a user called
"foo" or a group called "@foo", make sure you do not include "foo" as a valid
role in the ROLES hash.</p>

<p>You can keep things sane by using UPPERCASE names for roles, while keeping all
your user and group names lowercase; then you don't have to worry about this
problem.</p>

<h3>setting default roles</h3>

<p>You can setup some default role assignments as soon as a new wild repo is
created.</p>

<p>Here's how:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>enable the 'set-default-roles' feature in the rc file by uncommenting it
if it is already present or adding it to the ENABLE list if it is not.</p></li>
<li><p>supply a set of default role assignments for a wild repo pattern by adding
lines like this to the repo config para:</p>

<pre><code>option default.roles-1  =   READERS @all
option default.roles-2  =   WRITERS @senior-devs
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>This will then behave as if the <a href="user.html#perms">perms</a> command was used immediately after
the repo was created to add those two role assignments.</p>

<p>If you want to simulate the old (pre v3.5) <code>DEFAULT_ROLE_PERMS</code> rc file
variable, just add them under a <code>repo @all</code> line.  (Remember that this only
affects newly created wild repos, despite the '@all' name).</p>

<h3>specifying owners</h3>

<p>See the section on <code>OWNER_ROLENAME</code> in the <a href="rc.html">rc file documentation</a>.</p>

<h2>listing wild repos</h2>

<p>In order to see what repositories were created from a wildcard, use the 'info'
command.  Try <code>ssh git@host info -h</code> to get help on the info command.</p>

<h2>deleting a wild repo</h2>

<p>Run the whimsically named "D" command -- try <code>ssh git@host D -h</code> for more info
on how to delete a wild repo.  (Yes the command is "D"; it's meant to be a
counterpart to the "C" permission that allowed you to create the repo in the
first place).  Of course this only works if your admin has enabled the command
(gitolite ships with the command disabled for remote use).</p>
