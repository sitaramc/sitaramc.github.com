<p><a name="tips_recover_dropped_stash_the_GUI_way_"></a></p>

<h2>the GUI way</h2>

<p>You dropped a stash that was created recently, and now you want to recover it.
As long as you did not do a garbage collection in between, this should work:</p>

<pre><code>gitk $(git fsck | grep commit | cut -f3 -d' ') --since='1 week ago'
</code></pre>

<p>The part within the parenthesis finds all unreachable commit objects and
returns their hashes.  If you never did a garbage collect there might be too
many false positives so the <code>--since</code> clause (which you can adjust to whatever
you want of course; mine is just an example) limits the display to commits
created recently.</p>

<p>A "stash" has a very recognisable, triangular, shape in the commit DAG, and
with gitk you can visually find stashes really fast.  For me, this is the kind
of task that <em>calls out</em> for a GUI -- infrequently required, no conceivable
need to automate, and containing data that stands out visually.</p>

<p><a name="tips_recover_dropped_stash_the_command_line_way_"></a></p>

<h2>the command line way</h2>

<p>Writing something longer than that for a problem that occurs once in a blue
moon is not my style (very low ROI!), but doener gave me this:</p>

<pre><code>git fsck --unreachable | grep commit | cut -d\  -f3 |
xargs git log --no-walk --merges --grep='^\(WIP on \|On \)\((no branch)\|[^ ]\+\):'
</code></pre>

<p>I knew about <code>--merges</code> but not <code>--no-walk</code>, and I anticipate using it a lot
more in future :-)</p>
