<h1>(not git-specific) version control habits of good developers</h1>

<p>This article is based on <a href="http://blog.bstpierre.org/version-control-habits">http://blog.bstpierre.org/version-control-habits</a> -- a
blog post that is well worth checking out, especially if you want more
details.  However, this article represents my priorities on this matter, and
most of the words are mine.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>USE IT</strong>!  If you don't use version control you should get out of the
software development profession!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>check-in often</strong>: check-in when some logical unit of work is done
(compiles OK after major changes, or some feature is complete, or some
test was passed, etc.).  "going home for the day" is NOT a logical unit of
work; ideally you should not treat the version control system as a "backup
mechanism".  If you do this sort of time-based check-in, "<em>the danger is
that if you have to revert because you've made some disastrous changes,
you won't have a sane state to revert to</em>."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>check-in bite sized chunks</strong>: large check-ins are hard to review, and
harder to revert</p>

<ul>
<li>if you check-in 20 "logical units of work" in one shot, and the 3rd and
the 14th are bad, you'll have to revert the entire check-in, remove
changes 3 and 14, and then check-in again.  If you checked them all in
separately, you can revert just the changes that were not acceptable,
while retaining all the other stuff</li>
<li>if the "feature" is too large, create a branch and check-in locally</li>
<li>however, check-ins should be <strong>atomic</strong> -- for instance, a related
change in 2 ".c" files and a ".h" file should not become 3 check-ins if
those changes all depend on each other.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>make sure you include everything that is needed to rebuild the
project</strong>: (this is more for single-developer projects) since we don't
want to check-in binary files like executables and libraries, we normally
set up the VCS to ignore some files based on extension or whatever.  This
list has to be made carefully, and reviewed once in a while, otherwise
something that is important to the build may get left out!</p>

<ul>
<li>in git, you can temporarily rename the .gitignore file and then do a
"git status" (or run "git gui") to see the files that git is ignoring</li>
<li>or you can clone the entire project into a new directory and see if it
compiles</li>
<li><p>or you can run:</p>

<p>git ls-files --exclude-standard -o -i</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>take backups</strong>!  Don't use the version control system as a backup
medium</p></li>
<li><p><strong>keep "data" outside the "source" tree</strong>: putting data in the same
directory as the source tree is a very bad practice, and in fact I expect
seasoned programmers who are reading this to go "huh?  somebody actually
does stupid things like that?" :-)  Small amounts of textual data used to
trigger specific tests are OK, and may even benefit from version control
in the sense that a test suite is an integral part of any software with
longevity.  But anything larger than that, and more so if they are binary
blobs, should NOT be in the repository.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>don't break the build</strong>!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>update ("git pull") regularly</strong>: otherwise, you risk a large effort in
resolving conflicts when you eventually do pull</p></li>
<li><p><strong>write good check-in comments</strong>: this helps people understand the
evolution of the project much better over a long period of time.  Don't
forget the second purpose of a VCS is annotation: who changed it, what did
they change, and <strong>why</strong>?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>use branches or holding areas</strong>: branching and merging is cheap and
easy, and helps you keep things separate in your own mind too.  Having a
hierarchy of branches is very useful.  For instance:</p>

<ul>
<li>"master" is what is pulled from/pushed to the repository, "work" is
where you do the day-to-day development, "ut" is where you unit test,
pulling specific commits from "work" for a build and a test, "st-it" is
for integration test/system test, and so on.</li>
<li>in git, it's easy to use the "gitk" gui to pick individual changes from
another branch into the current one</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
