<h1>what does "git pull --rebase" do?</h1>

<p>[To understand this article you need to understand what a reflog is, and what
a rebase does, especially the full form of the rebase command]</p>

<p>[My initial article was a little simplistic; more exact details added thanks
to doener!]</p>

<hr />

<p>Sometimes we have an upstream that rebased/rewound a branch we're depending
on.  This can be a big problem -- causing messy conflicts for us if we're
downstream.</p>

<p>Without going into why they would do that, and how many beers (I prefer
rum+coke, thank you!) should be offered in compensation to downstream users,
let's just try and describe how git helps you deal with it.</p>

<p>The magic is <code>git pull --rebase</code>.</p>

<p>A normal <code>git pull</code> is, loosely speaking, something like this (we'll use a
remote called <code>origin</code> and a branch called <code>foo</code> in all these examples):</p>

<pre><code># assume current checked out branch is "foo"
git fetch origin
git merge origin/foo
</code></pre>

<p>At first glance, you might think that a <code>git pull --rebase</code> does just this:</p>

<pre><code>git fetch origin
git rebase origin/foo
</code></pre>

<p>But that will not help if the upstream rebase involved any "squashing"
(meaning that the <code>patch-id</code>s of the commits changed, not just their order).</p>

<p>Which means <code>git pull --rebase</code> has to do a little bit more than that.  Here's
an explanation of what it does and how.</p>

<p>Let's say your starting point is this:</p>

<pre><code>a---b---c---d---e  (origin/foo) (also your local "foo")
</code></pre>

<p>Time passes, and you have made some commits on top of your own "foo":</p>

<pre><code>a---b---c---d---e---p---q---r (foo)
</code></pre>

<p>Meanwhile, in a fit of anti-social rage, the upstream maintainer has not only
rebased his "foo", he even used a squash or two.  His commit chain now looks
like this:</p>

<pre><code>a---b+c---d+e---f  (origin/foo)
</code></pre>

<p>A <code>git pull</code> at this point would result in chaos.  Even a <code>git fetch; git
rebase origin/foo</code> would not cut it, because commits "b" and "c" on one side,
and commit "b+c" on the other, would conflict.  (And similarly with d, e, and
d+e).</p>

<p>What <code>git pull --rebase</code> does, in this case, is:</p>

<pre><code>git fetch origin
git rebase --onto origin/foo e foo
</code></pre>

<p>This gives you:</p>

<pre><code>a---b+c---d+e---f---p---q---r (foo)
</code></pre>

<p>You may still get conflicts, but they will be genuine conflicts (between p/q/r
and a/b+c/d+e/f), and not conflicts caused by b/c conflicting with b+c, etc.</p>

<hr />

<p>So how does this actually work?</p>

<p>The command tries to find out which commits are <em>really</em> your local ones, and
which had come from upstream in an earlier fetch.</p>

<p>To do this, it looks at the reflog of the remote tracking branch
(<code>origin/foo</code>, in this case).  This reflog represents the tips of successive
<code>git fetch</code> operations on <code>origin</code>, in "most recent first" order.</p>

<p>For each reflog entry, (<code>origin/foo@{1}</code>, then <code>...{2}</code>, and so on) it checks
if that commit is an ancestor of the current branch head <code>foo</code>.  As soon as it
finds one, it picks it as the starting point for the rebase (<code>e</code> in the
example above).</p>

<p>That might sound a little complicated, but it works out fine.  Just try it
next time your upstream rebases something on you.</p>
