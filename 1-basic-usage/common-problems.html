<h1>common problems and gotchas</h1>

<p><a name="1_basic_usage_common_problems_windows_keeping_files_open_in_an_editor_"></a></p>

<h2>(windows) keeping files open in an editor</h2>

<p>Windows does not allow you to overwrite or delete a file that is open in an
editor.  As a result, operations such as <code>git pull</code>, <code>merge</code>,
<code>rebase</code>, etc., may experience weird problems if they attempt to update
one of the files you have kept open.</p>

<p>If you get funky errors while doing any git operations, close all editors and
try again!</p>

<p><a name="1_basic_usage_common_problems_Not_currently_on_any_branch__"></a></p>

<h2>"Not currently on any branch"?</h2>

<p>In the graphical tool <code>gitk</code>, any "branch" that has a leading part in
yellow is a <strong>remote</strong> branch.  Do not checkout such a branch until you get a
little more familiar with git.  It is <strong>not a local branch</strong>, so checking it
out makes no sense.  For normal users, the GUI should prevent this, but it
doesn't, so I'm mentioning it.  (Think of it like a link to an XLS on a
website -- you can click the link and open it and edit it, but you can't save
it back to where it came from!)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>you will recognise you are in such a branch by one of these symptoms</p>

<ul>
<li><code>gitk</code> does not show any branch name in <strong>bold</strong> when you quit and
restart it</li>
<li><code>git gui</code> says <code>current branch: HEAD</code> at the top left</li>
<li><code>git status</code> says <code>Not currently on any branch</code></li>
<li>you are able to commit your changes but when you push them to the
remote server nothing seems to happen</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>to fix this:</p>

<ul>
<li>first give that branch a name to better deal with it for later
troubleshooting: <code>git checkout -b some_new_name</code></li>
<li>then you figure out how to merge those changes into one of the main
branches</li>
<li>then you push</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Update: I have since written about this in <a href="concepts/detached-head.html">more depth
here</a>.</p>

<p><a name="1_basic_usage_common_problems_simple_gotchas_at_the_command_line_"></a></p>

<h2>simple gotchas at the command line</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><code>git log rev</code> and <code>git diff rev</code> go in different directions.  Log shows
backward from the rev given, while diff goes forward from rev to the
working directory.</p></li>
<li><p>many commands inherit options from lower level programs and their man
pages will appear incomplete.  Read carefully to see what other commands'
options are applicable to this one.  For example, <code>git-log</code> inherits from
<code>git-rev-list</code> and <code>git-diff-tree</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>using <code>cp -a</code> copy instead of <code>git clone</code> will screw the timestamps.  A
subsequent <code>git add .</code> will make it look like every file has changed, in
terms of just the time stamp.  <em>Fix this by using <code>git status</code>, which
updates the index for such cases as a side effect.</em></p></li>
<li><p>confused by <code>HEAD^</code>, <code>HEAD~1</code>, etc.?  <code>man git-rev-parse</code> has a good
diagram.  And remember the reflog is quite different and has a different
syntax (<code>HEAD@{2</code>}).</p></li>
<li><p>cloning a repo: the following two commands are different; see
<a href="http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/git/2007/10/1/326757">http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/git/2007/10/1/326757</a> (summary: the
second one uses the git protocol, and makes no assumptions about the
original and the clone being on the same file system or even machine)</p>

<pre><code>git clone foo bar           # versus
# FIXME: fix this after permanent conversion to MD is over; should be
# a triple-slash after the "file:"
git clone file:/*foo bar
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>git ls-tree</code> does not seem to work well when not at the root of
<code>$GIT_WORK_TREE</code></p></li>
</ul>
