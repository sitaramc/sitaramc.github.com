<h1>try it and see...</h1>

<p>It's easy to forget that a lot of git's features, including features concerned
with remote repos like fetch/pull/push, can be safely and easily tried out
<strong>locally</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>start with an empty directory</li>
<li>create a new bare repo in it (e.g., <code>git init --bare b.git</code>).  This is
your <strong>server</strong> repo!</li>
<li>clone this one or more times (e.g., <code>git clone b.git c1; git clone b.git
c2</code>).  These are your <strong>developer</strong> repos; you can treat each one as
belonging to a different developer.  The "server" repo you cloned from
will be defined as the remote called "origin" in each of these clones.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now you're ready to test out whatever features you want using any or all of
the clones you created.</p>

<p>Notice that we are simply using the local file system as the transport
protocol.  People familiar with URLs on a browser might recognise this as eqvt
to <code>file:///full/path/to/something</code>, and indeed that is exactly what git
treats it as.</p>

<p>Using ssh or http merely changes</p>

<ul>
<li>the URL used</li>
<li>the authentication required and permissions granted by the server</li>
</ul>

<p>What <strong>does NOT change</strong> is the behaviour of most git commands!</p>

<p>This means you can play with git to your heart's content in some temporary
directory.  There's no danger of messing up a real repo, or of getting
side-tracked by connectivity or permissions or even speed issues, which might
happen if you tried this with a real server.</p>

<p>If playing on a test repo is not sufficient for your needs, you can replace
the "create a new bare repo" step with a clone of one of your real repos.  For
example, I might do this:</p>

<pre><code>git clone --bare git://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite.git b.git
</code></pre>

<p>and that would give me a "b.git" that is a bare repo that starts out with all
the code and branches that my real server repo has.</p>

on "accessing remote repositories".</p>
