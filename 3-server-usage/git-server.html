<h1>setting up your own git server</h1>

<p><code>git</code> is a <em>distributed</em> version control system (DVCS), and every developer
thus has his/her own repository.  A central server is therefore not a
technical requirement, but more of a practical and/or administrative one, if
at least as a place for the "official" version of your repo.</p>

<h2>(sidebar: defining authentication and authorisation)</h2>

<p>In order for some of the following to make sense, we need to define the words
"authentication" and "authorisation".</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Authentication</strong> is the process of verifying that you are who you claim
  to be.  An authentication system will establish that I am the user
  "sitaram" on my work system.  The one behind gmail will similarly
  establish that I am "sitaramc".  And so on...</p>

<p><strong>Authorisation</strong> is the process of asking what you want to do and
  deciding if you're allowed to do it or not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a name="protocols"></a></p>

<h2>protocols that git uses</h2>

<p><font color="gray"></p>

<p><strong>Sidenote on URLs and "remotes"</strong>: regardless of what protocol a server uses,
the client-side git commands work pretty much the same, once a "remote" has
been defined with the appropriate URL.</p>

<p>For most common usage patterns, you only need the URL in the <code>git clone</code>
command, which automatically sets up a "remote" called <code>origin</code> that points to
the URL you just used.</p>

<p>Sometimes you will need to manually add a new remote using <code>git remote</code> if you
have another server to deal with.  See <code>man git-remote</code> for details.</p>

<p></font></p>

<p>Git uses the following protocols to access remote repositories; example URLs
are given in parentheses:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>ssh</strong> (<code>ssh://user@my.server/path/to/repo</code>).  Authentication is handled
by ssh.  See the section on "gitolite and other tools" for authorisation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>http/https</strong>: (<code>http://my.server/path/to/repo</code>).  Authentication is
handled by the web server.  Authorisation <em>can</em> be handled by gitolite if
you're using "smart http" (see 'man git-http-backend').</p></li>
<li><p><strong>local file system</strong>: (<code>file:///path/to/repo</code>).  Authentication is not
relevant (you're already logged in).</p>

<p>Authorisation is handled by OS file-system permissions, but there's a
little twist.  Using OS permissions, or even filesystem ACLs, you can only
get repo-level granularity for reads and writes (i.e., you can say Alice
can read the repo, Bob can read and write, and Carol cannot do either, but
that;s it).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>git</strong>: (<code>git://my.server/path/to/repo</code>).  This is an <em>UNAUTHENTICATED</em>
protocol, useful only for allowing clones of publicly accessible repos.
If they can reach port 9418 on your server, they can get it.  Pushes are
disabled by default, and -- needless to say -- you must <em>NEVER</em> enable
them!</p>

<p>This protocol is handled by the special 'git-daemon' program, which you
can run either directly or via inetd/xinetd.  Please see its man page etc
for details.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This document will concentrate on ssh access.  I'm not too familiar with http,
even though gitolite supports "smart http".  The other 2 modes have been dealt
with and/or are pretty simple.</p>

<h2>ssh setup for...</h2>

<p><a name="3_server_usage_git_server_just_yourself_"></a></p>

<h3>...just yourself</h3>

<p>When you have a setup just for yourself, things are quite simple.  You setup a
bare repo on the server, add a remote to the repo on your workstation (or
clone <em>from</em> the server).  So first you do:</p>

<pre><code># on your userid on the server
git init --bare reponame
</code></pre>

<p>Then, if you don't already have an existing repo on your workstation, you do:</p>

<pre><code># on your workstation
git clone yourname@server:path/to/reponame
cd reponame
# start work
</code></pre>

<p>or, if you have a local repo on which you already did some work:</p>

<pre><code># on your workstation
cd reponame
git remote add origin yourname@server:path/to/reponame
# start work
</code></pre>

<p>Authentication is either by password or public key; it doesn't matter.
Authorisation is not done; you get access to everything.</p>

<p><a name="3_server_usage_git_server_just_yourself_and_a_few_others_with_total_trust__"></a></p>

<h3>...just yourself and a few others, with "total trust"</h3>

<p>(total trust means anyone can do anything to any repo and you trust all of
them to do the right thing and not do the wrong thing).</p>

<p>Now you will need to create a common userid on the server (unless you're
willing to give them all access to <em>your</em> userid on the server).</p>

<p>Let's say this common id is "git".  Everyone should know the password, or you
can collect their public keys and add all of them to <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>
on the server to have some means of adding and removing users without changing
passwords and communicating the new one to everyone.</p>

<p>The git commands are the same as in the previous section.</p>

<p>Note the phrase "total trust" -- you will not know who pushed what if you do
this, but for small, close-knit, teams it does not matter.</p>

<p><a name="3_server_usage_git_server_any_number_of_people_but_without_total_trust__"></a></p>

<h3>...any number of people but without "total trust"</h3>

<p>With any other situation, it's best if you just install gitolite or something
similar.  You need authorisation; just authentication will not do any more.</p>

<p><a name="3_server_usage_git_server_gitolite_and_others_tools_for_authorisation_"></a></p>

<h2>gitolite and others tools for authorisation</h2>

<p>There are many situations where you need to establish limits on what someone
can do.  When you have a number of developers, with varying levels of
experience and expertise, accessing a number of repos, and different branches
in different repos have different levels of "importance", you need some
serious authorisation tool.</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite">Gitolite</a> is the best such tool I know (blame author bias if you don't
agree!).  It comes with a <a href="http://sitaramc.github.com/gitolite/index.html#qi">quick
install</a> section, plus lots
and lots of <a href="http://sitaramc.github.com/gitolite">documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Other tools exist, but they are all web-based.  Google for "gitorious" or
"gerrit code review", for access control tools.  For open source projects or
if you don't mind paying a small amount of money, Github is very nice.
(Gitolite's primary host is Github, and I have no other relationship with them
than being a free user).</p>

<p><a name="3_server_usage_git_server_side_note_setting_limits_on_yourself_"></a></p>

<h3>side note: setting limits on yourself</h3>

<p>Strictly speaking, you might need to set limits on even <em>yourself</em>.  Let's say
you have a bad habit of running <code>git push -f</code>, and you want to protect from a
shoot-yourself-in-the-foot episode.</p>

<p>One way to do this is to run <code>git config receive.denyNonFastForwards true</code> on
the repo (server-side, not client-side).  This blocks rewind pushes, which is
great, but it does so for the <em>entire</em> repo; you can't choose to protect only
certain important branches this way.  Using something like gitolite makes this
possible.</p>

<p><a name="3_server_usage_git_server_appendix_A_compiling_tips_"></a></p>

<h2>appendix A: compiling tips</h2>

<p>If you're not able to install git using your system's normal install
mechanisms, you may end up having to compile it.</p>

<p>You may find that setting <code>NO_CURL</code>, <code>NO_EXPAT</code>, and <code>NO_TCLTK</code> may help if
you are missing dependencies.  The first two will prevent http-pull/push from
being built, but I never use those protocols anyway, so I don't care :-)  The
third one will prevent the GUI tools from being built, which does not matter
on a server</p>
